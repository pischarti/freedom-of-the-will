# Reconciling God's Sovereignty & Human Freedom

## Overview

Whedon asserts that God's sovereignty is better expressed through wisdom and power, allowing for resistible grace and genuine human choice, rather than meticulous control, which he sees as limiting God. He argues that the theory of non-prevention preserves both divine sovereignty (through foreknowledge and wisdom) and human freedom (through genuine choice), making God's rule more impressive and less contradictory than Edwards' deterministic system.

### Argument: God's Sovereignty Through Wisdom and Power

- **Chapter:** Part II, Section III (The Theological Argument), especially Chapters I, IV, VI, VIII
- **Section:** Foreknowledge and Predestination; Predestination an Unnecessary Hypothesis; Non-Necessitation of the Divine Will; Freedom Exalts Man and Dishonors God?
- **Details:** Whedon asserts that God's sovereignty is better expressed through wisdom and power, allowing for resistible grace and genuine human choice, rather than meticulous control, which he sees as limiting God.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** True divine sovereignty consists in wisdom and power to govern free moral agents, not in meticulous control that eliminates their freedom.
- **Minor Premise:** Libertarian free will allows God to exercise sovereignty through foreknowledge and non-prevention, while necessitarianism reduces God to a manipulator of mechanisms.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, God's sovereignty is better expressed and more glorious when it allows for genuine human freedom and resistible grace.
- **Corollary 1:** The theory of non-prevention preserves both divine sovereignty (through foreknowledge and wisdom) and human freedom (through genuine choice).
- **Corollary 2:** Denying human freedom actually degrades God's sovereignty by reducing him from a ruler of free subjects to a manipulator of mechanisms.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Ponens structure). If the premises are true, the conclusion follows necessarily.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** The major premise assumes that "true divine sovereignty" requires free moral agents, which some might dispute. However, Whedon provides arguments from God's nature and governance to support this.
  - **False Dichotomy:** Could sovereignty be expressed in ways other than meticulous control or libertarian freedom? Whedon addresses this by showing that non-prevention is a third option that preserves both sovereignty and freedom.
  - **Circular Reasoning:** Does the argument assume what it's trying to prove? No—the premises are supported by independent arguments about God's nature, wisdom, and the requirements of just governance.
- **Strengths:** The syllogism avoids common fallacies and provides a coherent alternative to Edwards' deterministic view.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** The major premise's definition of "true divine sovereignty" may be contested by those who define sovereignty as absolute control. Whedon addresses this by showing that such control actually limits God's glory.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Theory of Non-Prevention (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon presents the libertarian alternative: "The former maintains that while God foreknows that in a given course of the most wise divine conduct a free agent will, with full power to do otherwise, bring sin into existence, he, nevertheless, neither destroys the agent nor prevents his sin, but prosecutes his own course of most perfect wisdom to the best result. This may be called the theory of NON-PREVENTION." This preserves both divine sovereignty and human freedom.

2. **God's Dependence on the Finite (Part II, Section III, Chapter VIII):** Whedon argues that God's action being conditioned on finite beings is not a limitation but a necessary aspect of governance: "The assumption... that the action of God cannot be conditioned on the action or other actions, matter of a finite being... renders creation, preservation, government, retribution all alike impossible." He shows that "Government requires laws which must depend upon the nature of the being or thing to be governed."

3. **Freedom Exalts Rather Than Degrades God (Part II, Section III, Chapter VIII):** Whedon argues: "The denying the freedom of man does not honor but degrade God's sovereignty, sinking him from the position of a Ruler of free subjects to a manipulator of mechanisms. It takes from him the possibility of justice by making him propel the act he is to punish." He contends that "to exalt man's Will... is to exalt man in that respect in which he is in 'the image of God,' and in which to depreciate him below his measure is to dishonor his Original."

4. **Predestination as Unnecessary Hypothesis (Part II, Section III, Chapter IV):** Whedon argues that predestination is unnecessary because foreknowledge is sufficient: "Predestination is the causative, logical, and chronological antecedent of the fact; foreknowledge is the consequent." He shows that "Foreknowledge takes shape from the fact; Predestination shapes the fact." God's foreknowledge of free actions does not require predestination.

5. **Divine Free Volitivity (Part II, Section III, Chapter VI):** Whedon maintains that God himself possesses free will: "It is eternally that he possesses full power for choice of right or wrong; and it is eternally that he chooses solely right." He argues that "to maintain the freedom of the divine Will from any such causative determination of volitions is to maintain its dignity and honor."

**Comparison with Edwards:**

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 4, Section 7:** [The necessity of God's will](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-7-the-necessity-of-gods-will) - Edwards addresses the objection that his system makes God's will necessary, arguing that this is not problematic. He maintains that God's will is determined by the strongest motive (what appears most fit), and that this necessity does not diminish God's sovereignty or glory.
- **Part 4, Section 8:** [Discussion of further objections against the moral necessity of God's volitions](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-8-discussion-of-further-objections-against-the-moral-necessity-of-gods-volitions) - Edwards argues that if there is always a best option in all God's choice-situations, then "it would not be dishonorable or in any way unworthy or unsuitable for God's will to be necessarily determined in everything." He contends that necessity does not clash with "the liberty, supremacy, independence, and glory of God."
- **Part 2, Section 11:** [The evidence that God has certain foreknowledge of the volitions of moral agents](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-11-the-evidence-that-god-has-certain-foreknowledge-of-the-volitions-of-moral-agents) - Edwards argues for God's foreknowledge, which Whedon shows requires determinism under Edwards' system.
- **Part 2, Section 12:** [God can't have certain foreknowledge of the future volitions of moral agents if they are contingent](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-12-god-cant-have-certain-foreknowledge-of-the-future-volitions-of-moral-agents-if-they-are-contingent-in-a-way-that-excludes-all-necessity) - Edwards argues that God's foreknowledge requires necessity, making all volitions determined.

**Key Differences:**
- Edwards argues that God's will is necessarily determined, which Whedon shows degrades divine sovereignty.
- Whedon demonstrates that Edwards' system reduces God from a ruler of free subjects to a manipulator of mechanisms.
- The theory of non-prevention provides a superior model that preserves both divine sovereignty and human freedom.

**Practical implications:**
- Whedon shows that resistible grace allows God to offer salvation genuinely while respecting human freedom.
- The system of non-prevention demonstrates God's wisdom in governing free agents without violating their freedom.
- God's sovereignty is magnified, not diminished, by ruling over free moral agents rather than automatons.
