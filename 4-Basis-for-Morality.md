# Basis for Morality

## Overview

Whedon contends that only authentic libertarian freedom can serve as a true basis for human moral responsibility and a just divine government, preventing God from being the author of sin. He establishes the fundamental maxim that "no act can be morally obligatory, responsible, or guilty—no agent can be morally obligated, rewardable, or punishable—unless there be in the agent adequate power for other act than the act in question." This maxim requires libertarian freedom and provides the foundation for genuine moral accountability.

### Argument: Libertarian Freedom as Foundation for Morality

- **Chapter:** Part III, especially Chapters III, V, IX, X
- **Section:** Distinction Between Automatic Excellence and Moral Desert; The Maxim of Responsibility; Coaction and Necessitation; Argument from God's Non-Authorship of Sin
- **Details:** Whedon contends that only authentic libertarian freedom can serve as a true basis for human moral responsibility and a just divine government, preventing God from being the author of sin.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** True moral responsibility requires that an agent could have done otherwise (libertarian freedom).
- **Minor Premise:** Only libertarian free will provides the genuine ability to choose between alternatives, even against strong inclinations.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, libertarian free will is the necessary and sufficient basis for human moral responsibility and just divine government.
- **Corollary 1:** Without libertarian freedom, God becomes the author of sin, undermining both human accountability and divine justice.
- **Corollary 2:** Libertarian freedom provides the foundation for a truly retributive moral government where rewards and punishments are just.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Ponens structure). The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** Does the major premise assume what needs to be proven? Whedon supports this with the maxim of responsibility and analogies (automaton, watch) that demonstrate the intuitive connection between "could have done otherwise" and responsibility.
  - **False Dilemma:** Could there be other bases for morality besides libertarian freedom? Whedon addresses this by showing that compatibilism fails to provide genuine responsibility, making libertarian freedom the only viable option.
  - **Circular Reasoning:** Does the argument assume responsibility exists to prove freedom exists? No—Whedon uses the reality of responsibility (which all parties acknowledge) to demonstrate the necessity of freedom.
- **Strengths:** The syllogism is logically sound and grounded in the fundamental maxim of responsibility that both sides accept.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** Edwards would dispute the major premise, arguing that responsibility doesn't require "could have done otherwise." Whedon addresses this by showing Edwards' position leads to contradictions (God as author of sin, humans as machines).

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Maxim of Responsibility (Part III, Chapter V):** Whedon establishes the fundamental principle: "no act can be morally obligatory, responsible, or guilty—no agent can be morally obligated, rewardable, or punishable—unless there be in the agent adequate power for other act than the act in question." This maxim requires libertarian freedom.

2. **Distinction Between Automatic Excellence and Moral Desert (Part III, Chapter III):** Whedon uses the automaton and watch analogies to show that necessitated actions cannot bear moral responsibility: "The highest order of mechanical or automatic excellence is found in a watch... And yet, literally and coolly, we attribute only automatic excellence; and we are utterly unable to see in it the slightest intrinsic trace of moral merit or demerit."

3. **Coaction and Necessitation Equivalence (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon demonstrates that "coaction by physical force or necessitation by motive influence places, and equally places, the act out of the power of the agent." He argues: "Now power must underlie obligation. An act for which the agent has not the adequate power both volitional and physical, cannot be the subject of just obligation nor just command."

4. **God's Non-Authorship of Sin (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon shows that libertarian freedom prevents God from being the author of sin: "From the Will of God to the act of the sinner the line of causation through all the intermediates is a straight line" under determinism, making God responsible. Under libertarianism, "God foreknows that in a given course... a free agent will, with full power to do otherwise, bring sin into existence" - preserving God's justice.

5. **Created Moral Desert Impossible (Part III, Chapter IV):** Whedon argues that necessitated actions cannot create moral desert: "Created moral desert impossible" under determinism because "the agent has not the adequate power for other act." Only libertarian freedom allows for genuine moral desert.

**Comparison with Edwards:**

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 3, Section 1:** [God's moral excellence is necessary, yet virtuous and praiseworthy](Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-1-gods-moral-excellence-is-necessary-yet-virtuous-and-praiseworthy) - Edwards argues that necessary actions can be virtuous and praiseworthy, using God as an example. Whedon shows this creates contradictions when applied to humans.
- **Part 3, Section 2:** [The acts of the will of Jesus Christ's human soul were necessarily holy, yet truly virtuous, praiseworthy, rewardable etc.](Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-2-the-acts-of-the-will-of-jesus-christs-human-soul-were-necessarily-holy-yet-truly-virtuous-praiseworthy-rewardable-etc) - Edwards uses Christ's necessary holiness to argue that necessity doesn't eliminate virtue. Whedon shows this is inconsistent with Edwards' own principles.
- **Part 3, Section 3:** [Moral necessity and inability are consistent with blameworthiness](Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-moral-necessity-and-inability-are-consistent-with-blameworthiness-this-is-shown-by-the-case-of-people-whom-god-has-given-up-to-sin-and-of-fallen-man-in-general) - Edwards directly argues that moral necessity is compatible with blameworthiness. Whedon demonstrates this is incoherent without libertarian freedom.
- **Part 4, Section 3:** [Why some people think it contrary to common sense to suppose that necessary actions can be worthy of either praise or blame](Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-why-some-people-think-it-contrary-to-common-sense-to-suppose-that-necessary-actions-can-be-worthy-of-either-praise-or-blame) - Edwards acknowledges the common sense objection but tries to reconcile it. Whedon shows this reconciliation fails.
- **Part 4, Section 4:** [Moral necessity is consistent with praise and blame, reward and punishment](Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-moral-necessity-is-consistent-with-praise-and-blame-reward-and-punishmentthis-squares-with-common-sense-and-mens-natural-notions) - Edwards' main attempt to reconcile necessity with responsibility, which Whedon shows is incoherent.
- **Part 4, Section 9:** [The objection that the doctrine maintained here implies that God is the author of sin](Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-9-the-objection-that-the-doctrine-maintained-here-implies-that-god-is-the-author-of-sin) - Edwards attempts to avoid making God the author of sin, which Whedon shows contradicts his determinism and undermines the basis for morality.

**Key Differences:**
- Edwards attempts to preserve responsibility while denying libertarian freedom, which Whedon shows is incoherent.
- Whedon demonstrates that Edwards' system makes God the author of sin, undermining the basis for morality.
- Libertarian freedom provides a coherent foundation that Edwards' compatibilism cannot.

**Practical benefits:**
- Provides a true basis for human moral responsibility where agents are genuinely accountable.
- Enables a just divine government where rewards and punishments are meaningful and fair.
- Prevents God from being the author of sin, preserving both divine justice and human accountability.
- Allows for genuine moral progress and character development through free choices.
