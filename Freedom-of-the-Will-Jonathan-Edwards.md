- **Section 3:** Can volition occur without a cause? Can any event do so?
- **Section 4:** Can volition occur without a cause because the soul is active?
- **Section 5:** Even if the things said in these attempted escapes were true, they are quite irrelevant and can't help the cause of Arminian liberty; so that Arminian writers have to talk inconsistently

### Part 3: The kind of liberty of will that Arminians believe in: is it necessary for moral agency, virtue and vice, praise and dispraise etc.?

- **Section 1:** God's moral excellence is necessary, yet virtuous and praiseworthy
- **Section 2:** The acts of the will of Jesus Christ's human soul were necessarily holy, yet truly virtuous, praiseworthy, rewardable etc.
- **Section 3:** Moral necessity and inability are consistent with blameworthiness. This is shown by the case of people whom God has given up to sin, and of fallen man in general
- **Section 4:** Command, and the obligation to obey, are consistent with moral inability to obey
- **Section 5:** A close look at the sincerity of desires and attempts, which is supposed to excuse the non-performance of things that are good in themselves
- **Section 6:** Liberty of indifference, rather than being required for virtue, is inconsistent with it. 'More generally', 'liberty' and 'moral agency' on the Arminian pattern are inconsistent with any habits' or inclinations' being virtuous or vicious
- **Section 7:** Arminian notions of moral agency are inconsistent with all influence of motive and inducement in both virtuous and vicious actions

---

### Part 4: Examining the main reasons the Arminians give for their view about liberty, moral agency etc. and against the opposite doctrine

- **Section 1:** What makes dispositions of the heart and acts of the will vicious or virtuous is not their cause but their nature
- **Section 2:** The falseness and inconsistency of the metaphysical notion of action and agency that most defenders of the Arminian doctrine of liberty, moral agency, etc. seem to have
- **Section 3:** Why some people think it contrary to common sense to suppose that necessary actions can be worthy of either praise or blame
- **Section 4:** 'Moral necessity is consistent with praise and blame, reward and punishment'—this squares with common sense and men's natural notions
- **Section 5:** Two objections considered: the 'no use trying' objection and (-near the end-) the 'mere machines' objection
- **Section 6:** The objection that the doctrine defended here agrees with Stoicism and with the opinions of Hobbes
- **Section 7:** The necessity of God's will
- **Section 8:** Discussion of further objections against the moral necessity of God's volitions
- **Section 9:** The objection that the doctrine maintained here implies that God is the author of sin
- **Section 10:** Sin's first entrance into the world
- **Section 11:** A supposed inconsistency between these principles and God's moral character

## Key Themes and Arguments

### Edwards' Central Thesis

Edwards argues that the Arminian notion of libertarian free will (the ability to choose otherwise, independent of determining causes) is:
1. **Logically inconsistent** - It involves self-contradictory concepts
2. **Metaphysically impossible** - It cannot exist as conceived
3. **Unnecessary for moral agency** - Moral responsibility does not require libertarian freedom

### Compatibilism

Edwards defends a compatibilist position:
- **Moral necessity** (determination by strongest motive) is consistent with moral responsibility
- The will is determined by the strongest motive, but this does not eliminate moral agency
- God's foreknowledge and determinism are compatible with human responsibility

### Key Distinctions

1. **Natural vs. Moral Necessity:**
   - Natural necessity: Physical impossibility (e.g., inability to fly)
   - Moral necessity: Determination by strongest inclination or motive

2. **Natural vs. Moral Inability:**
   - Natural inability: Lack of physical capacity
   - Moral inability: Lack of inclination or will (but not physical capacity)

### Arguments Against Libertarian Free Will

1. **Self-Determination is Circular:** The will cannot determine itself without an infinite regress
2. **Causation Argument:** Every event requires a cause; volitions are events and therefore require causes
3. **Foreknowledge Argument:** God's certain foreknowledge of future volitions implies their necessity
4. **Moral Agency Examples:** God and Christ demonstrate that necessary actions can be virtuous and praiseworthy

### Arguments for Compatibilism

1. **God's Virtue:** God's moral excellence is necessary, yet virtuous and praiseworthy
2. **Christ's Humanity:** Christ's human will was necessarily holy, yet truly virtuous
3. **Moral Inability:** People given up to sin show that moral inability is consistent with blameworthiness
4. **Commands and Obligations:** Commands are consistent with moral inability to obey

---

## The Manners and Morals of the Critics

Edwards concludes with a reflection on the reception of Calvinist doctrines:

> Many of the first reformers and others who followed them, whom God in their day made the chief pillars of his church and greatest instruments of their deliverance from error and darkness and of the promotion of piety among them, have been insulted by the contempt with which they have been treated by many recent writers for their teaching and maintaining the doctrines that are commonly called Calvinist.

Edwards challenges his Arminian critics:

> We might indeed challenge them to produce any doctrine that was ever accepted by the blindest bigot of the Church of Rome, or the most ignorant Moslem, or the wildest fanatic, that could be more conclusively shown to be self-contradictory and in conflict with common sense than theirs can be.

### On Scripture and Reason

Edwards argues that:

> It is in fact a glorious argument for the divinity of the holy scriptures that they teach doctrines such that, although this is true of them:
> 
> • At various times in history, through the blindness of men's minds and the strong prejudices of their hearts, they are rejected as most absurd and unreasonable by the 'wise and great' men of the world;
> 
> this is also true of them:
> 
> • When they are most carefully and strictly examined, they turn out to be perfectly in conformity with the most demonstrable, certain, and natural dictates of reason.

## Relationship to Whedon's Critique

This work by Edwards is the primary target of Whedon's critique in *The Freedom of the Will as a Basis of Human Responsibility and a Divine Government*. Whedon specifically addresses:

1. **Edwards' compatibilism** - Whedon argues it reduces to determinism
2. **God as author of sin** - Whedon shows Edwards' system makes God the author of sin
3. **Incoherence** - Whedon demonstrates contradictions in Edwards' attempt to preserve responsibility while denying libertarian freedom
4. **Mechanical reduction** - Whedon shows Edwards' view reduces human agency to mechanical responses

## Part I: Terms and Topics that will come up in the rest of the work

### Section 1: The nature of the will

signifies nothing but a power or ability to prefer or choose.’
On the previous page he says: ‘The word “preferring” seems
best to express the act of volition’, but then he adds that ‘it
doesn’t express it precisely; for although a man would •prefer
flying to walking, who can say he ever •wills to fly?’ This
example doesn’t prove that there is anything to •willing other
than merely •preferring. Bear in mind that the immediate
object of the will with respect to a man’s walking (or any other
external action) is not moving from one place to another on
the earth or through the air; these are more distant objects
of preference. The immediate object is this or that exertion
of himself—·for example, trying to move his legs, setting
himself to move his legs, willing to move his legs·. The next
to immediate thing that is chosen or preferred when a man
wills to walk is not •arriving at his chosen destination but
•his legs and feet moving in a way that will get him there.
And his willing this alteration in his body right now is simply
his choosing or preferring that alteration in his body right
now, or his liking it better than its non-occurrence. And God
has constructed human nature in such a way that when
a soul is united to a body that is in good condition, •the
soul’s preferring or choosing such an immediate alteration
of the body is instantaneously followed by •the alteration’s
occurring. When I walk, all that I am conscious of happening
in my mind are •my moment-by-moment preferences or
choices of such-and-such alterations of my external sensations and motions, together with •moment-by-moment
expectations that what I choose will indeed happen—because
I have always found in the past that when I have immediately
preferred those sorts of sensations and motions, they always
actually occur straight away. But it isn’t like that with

You may think that there is no great need to take trouble
to define or describe the will, because the word ‘will’ is
generally as well understood as any other words we might
use to explain it. You would be right if it weren’t for the fact
that scientists, philosophers, and polemical preachers have
thrown the will into darkness by the things they have said
about it. But that is the fact; so I think it may be of some
use, and will increase my chances of being clear throughout
this book, if I say a few things concerning it.
Well, then: setting aside metaphysical subtleties, the will
is that by which the mind chooses anything. The •faculty of
the will is the power of, or source in, the mind by which it is
capable of choosing; an •act of the will is an act of choosing
or choice.
If you think the will is better defined by saying that it is
that by which the soul either chooses or refuses, I’ll settle
for that; though I don’t think we need to add ‘or refuses’,
for in every act of will the mind chooses one thing rather
than another; it chooses something rather than the absence
or non-existence of that thing. So in every act of •refusal
the mind •chooses the absence of the thing refused, so
that refusing is just a special case of choosing. . . . So that
whatever names we give to the act of the will—
‘choosing’, ‘refusing’, ‘approving’, ‘disapproving’, ‘liking’, ‘disliking’, ‘embracing’, ‘rejecting’, ‘determining’,
‘directing’, ‘commanding’, ‘forbidding’, ‘inclining’, ‘being averse to’, ‘being pleased with’, ‘being displeased
with’
—they all come down to choosing. . . . Locke says: ‘The will


flying. It may be said that a man remotely chooses or prefers
flying; but given his view of his situation he doesn’t prefer or
desire any immediate movements of his limbs in order to fly,
because he doesn’t expect to get the desired end—·namely,
his flying·—by any such movements, and he doesn’t prefer or
incline towards any bodily movements that he thinks will be
entirely in vain. Thus, if we carefully distinguish the proper
objects of the various acts of the will in cases like these, we
won’t find any difference between volition and preference;
i.e. we won’t find that a man’s •choosing, liking best, or
being pleased with something are different from his •willing
it. Thus we often report an act of the will by saying ‘It pleases
him to’ do such-and-such; and in ordinary talk there is no
difference between ‘He does what he wills’ and ‘He does what
he pleases’.
Locke says:
The will is entirely distinct from desire. It can happen
that an action that our will gets us to perform is
contrary to our desire. A man whom I must obey may
require me to use persuasions to someone else, and it
may be that at the very time I am speaking I want the
persuasion to fail. In this case it is plain the will and
desire run counter to one another. (Essay II.xxi.30)
I don’t assume that ‘will’ and ‘desire’ mean exactly the same:
it seems that ‘desire’ has to do with something absent,
whereas ‘will’ can also cover things that are present: I may
prefer to be, as indeed I am, sitting here with my eyes open,
·but we wouldn’t say that I ‘desire’ it·. But I can’t think
that ‘will’ and ‘desire’ are so entirely distinct that they can
ever properly be said to go against each other. No-one ever
wills anything contrary to his desires, or desires anything
contrary to his will; and Locke’s example gives no proof to
the contrary. A man may for some reason say things that
will tend to persuade his hearer, and yet desire that they not



### Section 2: Determination of the will

[The word ‘determine’ and its relatives will occur often, starting now. It
can’t be systematically replaced by something more familiar. The basic
idea that it conveys is that of settling something, fixing it, or the like. In
an example that Edwards gives, to ‘determine the motion’ of something is
to make it go in that direction, to settle which of its possible directions it
will go in. When ‘determination’ can satisfactorily be replaced by ‘resolve’
or ‘decision’, as on page 32, that replacement is made.] If the phrase


‘determining the will’ is to be used with any meaning, it must
be
causing it to be the case that the act of the will, or the
choice, should be thus and not otherwise:
and the will is said to be ‘determined’ when
some event or influence causes its choice to be directed to and fixed upon a particular end.
As when we speak of the ‘determination of motion’, meaning
causing the motion of the body to be in this direction rather
than that. The determination of the will involves an •effect,
which must have a •cause. If the will is determined, something must determine it. This is part of what ‘determination’
means, even for those who say that The will determines itself.
If it does, then it is both determiner and determined; it is
a •cause that acts and has an •effect on itself, and is the
object of its own influence and action.
With respect to the great question ‘What determines the
will?’, there is no need now to go into a tedious study of
all the various answers that have been given to it; nor do I
need here to go into details of the disputes about that other
·related· question ‘Does the will always follow the last dictate
of the understanding?’ All I need to say for my purposes
is this: What determines the will is the motive that the mind
views as the strongest. But perhaps I should explain my
meaning a little.
By ‘motive’ I mean the whole of whatever it is—whether
it’s one thing or many things acting together as one complex
motive—that moves, excites, or invites the mind to ·perform
an act of· volition. . . .
Whatever is a ‘motive’ (in this sense) ·for a person· must
be something that that person’s understanding or perceiving
faculty has in its view. Nothing can encourage or invite the
mind to will or act in any way except to the extent that it is
perceived or is somehow in the mind’s view; for what is out



### Section 3: The meanings of 'necessary', 'impossible', 'unable' etc., and of 'contingent'

The words ‘necessary’, ‘impossible’ etc. are abundantly used
in controversies about free will and moral agency. So the
sense in which they are used should be clearly understood.
One might say that
•It is necessary that P when it must be the case that
P and can’t not be the case that P,
but this wouldn’t properly define ‘necessary’, any more than
·the reverse·
•It must be the case that P when it’s necessary that P
is a proper definition of ‘must’. The words ‘must’, ‘can’ and
‘cannot’ need to be explained as much as ‘necessary’ and
‘impossible’ do, the only difference being that ‘must’ etc. are
words that we use more as children than ‘necessary’ and
‘impossible’.
·’N ECESSARY ’ AS USED IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE·
‘Necessary’ as used in common speech is a relative term.
[The rest of this paragraph expands what Edwards wrote, in ways that

·small dots· can’t easily convey.] (a) We say ‘It is necessary for him



### Section 4: The division of necessity and inability into *natural* and *moral*

into natural and moral
The ·philosophical· necessity that I have explained divides
into •moral necessity and •natural necessity. You’ll recall
that this kind of necessity involves an infallible connection
between the thing signified by the subject and the thing
signified by the predicate of the relevant proposition; well,
such a case of necessity is classified as moral if the subject
of the proposition is a thinking being; otherwise not.
I shan’t stop to inquire into how sharp and deep this
distinction is; I shall merely explain how these two sorts of
necessity are understood as they are used in various places,
including this book.
The phrase ‘moral necessity’ has various uses; ·I shall
pick out three of them, two because they are pretty common,
and the third because it is the use I shall adhere to in this
book·. (i) There is the necessity of moral obligation: we say
that a man is under ·moral· necessity when he is subject
to bonds of duty and conscience from which he can’t be let


off (‘·He had to do it; he had solemnly promised to·’). An
analogous non-moral notion of necessity kicks in when we
say that someone is bound by his own interests (‘·He had
to do it; otherwise he’d have been ruined·’). (ii) Sometimes
the language of moral necessity is tied to the notion of moral
evidentness: it can be morally evident that P if the evidence
for P is strong enough to be relied on in moral reasoning.



### Section 5: The notions of liberty and moral agency

powers and faculties such as being cunning, brave, generous,
or zealous. But these qualities are properties of persons, not
properties of properties.
[Edwards repeats this point as applied to the opposite of
liberty; and remarks that it is presented ‘with great clearness’
in Locke’s Essay.]
One more point about what is called ‘liberty’ in common
speech: all it refers to is the person’s power and opportunity
to act •as he will or •according to his choice; the meaning
of the word doesn’t bring in anything about the cause of
•that choice or about how the person came to have •such a
volition. Was his choice or volition caused by some external
motive or internal habitual bias? determined by some
internal antecedent volition or happened without a cause?
necessarily connected with some previous state or event or
not so connected? The answers to questions like these have
no bearing on whether the person was free according to the
basic and common notion of freedom.
What I have said may be sufficient to show what ‘liberty’
means according to the common notions of mankind, and
in the usual and basic meaning of the word: but when the
word ‘liberty’ is used by Arminians, Pelagians and others who
oppose the Calvinists, it means something entirely different.

·L IBER TY·
The plain and obvious meaning of the words ‘freedom’
and ‘liberty’ in common speech is the power, opportunity, or
advantage that anyone has to do as he pleases. Or, in other
words, the person’s being free from blockage or obstacle in
the way of doing, or in any way conducting himself, as he
wills.1
And the opposite of liberty—whatever name we give it—is
a person’s being hindered or unable to do such-and-such as
he wills, i.e. his being necessitated to act otherwise.
I don’t think any fair-minded and competent speaker of
English will deny that what I have just offered is indeed the
meaning of ‘liberty’ in the ordinary speech. If it is, then liberty
and its opposite can’t properly be ascribed to any being that
doesn’t have a faculty—power—property—of the sort that is
called ‘will’. A thing can’t have a power or opportunity to act
according to its will, and can’t be necessitated to act contrary
to its will, if it doesn’t have a will! To talk as though the will
itself has liberty or its opposite is, therefore, nonsense—if
we identify sense and nonsense in terms of the basic and
proper meanings of words. The will is not an agent that has a
will; the power of choosing doesn’t have a power of choosing.

[Arminians were followers of Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609). Some of

[In this context, an ‘agent’ is simply something that acts. These days

his complex disagreements with Calvinism (of which Edwards was a

an ‘agent’ is usually someone who acts on behalf of someone else, but

proponent) will come up in the Conclusion of this book; but all that

that wasn’t part of the word’s meaning in Edwards’s time.] What has

matters just now is that Arminians differed from Calvinists about the

the power of volition—·the power of choosing, the faculty of
will·—is the •man or the •soul and not the •power of volition
itself. And someone who has the liberty to do what he wills
to do is the agent—the doer—who has the will, not the will
that he has. . . . Freedom is the property of an agent who has

workings of the human will, and the content of that disagreement will


appear clearly enough from Edwards’s text. Pelagians can for present
purposes be equated with Arminians, who are mentioned about 150
times in this book.] Here are three things that Arminians believe

about liberty. (a) It consists in a self-determining power in

I say not only ‘doing’ but also ‘conducting himself’, because voluntarily refraining from doing—e.g. sitting still, keeping quiet, and so on—are instances
of a person’s conduct, in which he can be at liberty; but they aren’t properly called doing.


the will, i.e. a certain sovereignty that the will has over itself
and its own acts, whereby it determines its own volitions to
the exclusion of any prior cause lying outside the will. (b)
Liberty involves indifference, i.e. it requires that until the act
of volition occurs the mind is evenly balanced ·between the
alternatives·. (c) Something else that is essential to liberty is
contingency—not •in the ordinary meaning of ‘contingency’
that I have explained [page 12] but •as opposed to all necessity,
i.e. to or any fixed and certain connection between the
contingent item and some previous reason for its existence
·or occurrence·. According to the Arminians, a man has no
real freedom, however much he is at liberty to act according
to his will, unless his will is ‘free’ in the sense given in this
paragraph.
·M ORAL AGENCY·
A moral agent is a being who is capable of actions that
have a moral quality and can properly be called ‘good’ or ‘evil’
in a moral sense—‘virtuous’ or ‘vicious’, ‘commendable’ or
‘faulty’. To be a moral agent one has to have
•a moral faculty—a sense of moral good and evil, or
of something’s deserving praise or blame, reward or
punishment; and one must also have •the ability to
be led by moral inducements—motives presented to
one’s understanding and reason—to act in ways that
are agreeable to one’s moral sense.
[Edwards lists some things that can do good (the sun)
or harm (house-fires) or both (‘the brute creatures’), but
are not moral agents. Then:] The moral agency of a •ruler
differs from that of a •subject in a circumstantial way—by
which I mean this: the ruler and the subject are in different
circumstances, so the moral inducements by which they
can be influenced are different. A ruler acting purely as a
ruler can’t be influenced by a moral law and its sanctions
of threats and promises, rewards and punishments, as the

## Part 2: The freedom of will that the Arminians think is the essence of the liberty of moral agents: Does it exist? Could it exist? Is it even conceivable?

### Section 1: The Arminian notion of liberty of will as consisting in the will's self-determining power—its obvious inconsistency

consisting in the will’s self-determining power—its
obvious inconsistency

on this basis. When they speak of the will’s determining
itself, I shall take it that what they mean by ‘the will’ is ‘the
willing soul’. I shall assume that when they speak of the
will as determining x they mean that the soul determines
x through its power of willing or acting voluntarily. That
is the only thing they can mean without gross and obvious
absurdity. Whenever we speak of powers-of-acting as doing
x, we mean that the agents that have these powers of
acting do x in the exercise of those powers. ‘Valour fights
courageously’—we mean the man who is influenced by valour
fights courageously. ‘Love seeks the beloved’—we mean that
the loving person seeks the beloved. ‘The understanding
detects x’—we mean that the soul in the exercise of its faculty
of understanding detects x. ‘The will decides or determines
x’—we had better mean that x is determined by the person
in the exercise of his power of willing and choosing, or by the
soul acting voluntarily.
[Edwards now offers an argument that he states in the
language of ‘the will determining itself’. He means this
to be understood as short-hand in the manner he has
just described, and the argument goes through on that
interpretation. Here it is, expressed without the distracting
‘self-determination’ idiom: Arminians say that every free
act someone performs—including every act of the will—was
caused by a preceding act; and if that had also to be free,
it was caused by a yet earlier act, and so on backwards.
How did this sequence of acts start? •If its first member
was a free act, then that act is a counter-example to the
Arminian thesis that freedom involves causation by a free
act. •If the first member was not a free act, then—given that

. . . .I shall now consider the Arminian notion of the freedom
of the will, and its supposed essentialness for moral agency,
i.e. for anyone’s being •capable of virtue or vice and •a fit
subject for command or advice, praise or blame, promises
or threats, rewards or punishments. The rival view is that
the only thing that does or can make someone a moral agent,
and make him a fit subject for praise or blame etc., is what
counts as ‘liberty’ in ordinary language. In this Part, I shall
discuss whether any such thing as Arminian freedom is
possible or conceivable; I shall discuss in Part 3 the question
of whether anything like Arminian freedom is necessary to
moral agency and so on. [The phrase ‘Arminian freedom’ replaces
Edwards’s ‘that freedom of the will that Arminians insist on’. Similar
abbreviations will be used several times in what follows.]

Let us start with the notion of a self-determining power in
the will, which is what the Arminians count as the absolute
essence of the will’s freedom. I shall especially press this
question: Isn’t it plainly absurd and a manifest inconsistency
to suppose that the will itself determines all the free acts of
the will? [See the note on ‘determine’ on page 3.]
There is a linguistic point that I want to set aside. It
is very improper to speak of the will as determining itself
·or anything else·, because the will is a •power, whereas
determining is done by •agents [see page 17]. This improper
way of speaking leads to many mistakes and much confusion,
as Locke observes, but I shan’t argue against the Arminians


it determined the second member of the sequence, which
determined the third etc.—it seems to follow that none of the
acts in the sequence has been free. Although this is obvious
at first glance, Edwards says, he proceeds to ‘demonstrate’ it.
Unfortunately, the ‘demonstration’ is stated in the language
of self -determination; we had better get used to it. Here it
is:]



### Section 2: Two attempted escapes from the foregoing reasoning

If the will governs itself and determines its own actions, it
doubtless does this in the same way that we find it governing
our limbs and determining how they shall move—namely by
antecedent volitions. The will determines how the hands and
feet shall move by an act of choice, and it has no other
way of determining, directing, or commanding anything.
Whatever the will commands, it commands by an act of
the will. . . . Thus, if the will’s freedom consists in its having
itself and its own actions under its command, so that its
own volitions are determined by itself, it will follow that every
free volition arises from an earlier volition that directed and
commanded it; and if that directing volition was also free,
it was determined by a still earlier one . . . and so on, until
we come to the first volition in the whole series. •If that first
volition is free—if it is a case of self-determination by the
will—then the Arminian must say that it too was determined
by a yet earlier volition—and that is a contradiction, because
here we are talking about the first act in the series. •And
if that first act of the will is not free, then none of the
following acts that are determined and fixed by it can be
free either. [Edwards tries to make this more intuitively
compelling •by stating it in terms of a five-act sequence, and
then maintaining that the point is just as good with ten acts
in the sequence, or a hundred or ten thousand. And •by
presenting an analogous argument about the movements of
links in a chain. Then:] If the first act on which the whole
sequence depends, and which determines all the rest, isn’t a

(A) Here is something that might be said in an attempt to
evade the force of what I have been saying:
When Arminians speak of the will as determining its
own acts, they don’t mean that the will determines an
act by any preceding act, or that one act of the will
determines another. All they mean is that the faculty
or power of will—or the soul in its use of that power—
determines its own volitions, doing this without any
act occurring before the act that is determined.
This is full of the most gross absurdity. I admit that I made it
up; and it might be an injustice to the Arminians to suppose
that any of them would make use of it. But it’s as good an
escape-attempt as I can invent, so I want to say a few things
about it.
(1) If the power of the will determines an act of volition—
meaning that the soul in its use or exercise of that power
determines it—that is the same thing as the soul’s determining the volition by an act of will. An •exercise of the power
of will and an •act of the will are the same thing. It is a
contradiction to say that the power of will—or the soul in the
use or exercise of that power—determines volition without
an act of will preceding the volition that is determined.
(2) If a •power of will determines the act of the will, then
•
a power of choosing determines it. As I pointed out earlier,
in every act of will there is choice, and a power of willing is


a power to choose. But if a power of choosing determines
the act of volition, it determines it by choosing it. It’s just
absurd to say that a power of choosing determines one thing
rather than another without choosing anything! But if a
power of choosing determines volition by choosing it, then
we are back with a preceding act again—the act of choosing.
(3) To say ‘The faculty or the soul •determines its own
volition, but not by any •act’ is a contradiction. For the soul
to direct, decide, or determine anything is to act. . . . And this
act can’t be identical with the act that it aims to produce; so
it must be something prior to it.
(4) The advocates for this ·Arminian· notion of the freedom
of the will speak of a certain sovereignty in the will that gives
it the power to determine its own volition. This means that
the determination of volition must itself be an exercise of
that supposed power and sovereignty, and that must be act
of the will.
(5) If the will determines itself, then in doing this either
it is active or it is not. If it is active, then the determination
is an act of the will. If it isn’t active in its determination of
itself, then how does it exercise any liberty in this?. . . .
(B) Here is a second kind of thing that might be said to
defend Arminianism from my attack:
Although it is true that if the soul determines its own
volitions, it must do so by acting in some way, the
relevant act doesn’t have to be prior to the volition
that it determines. It could be that the will or soul
determines the act of the will in performing that act; it
determines its own volition in the very act of volition;
it directs and shapes the act of the will, causing it to
be thus and not so, in performing the act and without
any preceding act.
Anyone who says something like this must mean one or other
of these three things. (1) The determining act precedes the



### Section 3: Can volition occur without a cause? Can any event do so?

any event do so?
Before starting in on this, I want to explain what I mean
by ‘cause’ in this discussion, because I shall—for want
of a better word—be using it in a broader sense than is
sometimes given to it. The word is often used in a narrow
sense in which it applies only to something that has a positive
effectiveness or influence in producing a thing or making an
event occur. But many things that have no such positive
productive influence are still causes, in that they really are
the reason why some events occur rather than others or why
the events are as they are. For example, the absence of the
sun in the night isn’t the cause of the fall of dew at that time
in the same way as its beams are the cause of mist rising in
the day-time; and the sun’s withdrawal in the winter isn’t
the cause of the freezing of lakes in the same way as its
approach in the spring is the cause of their thawing. And
yet the absence (or withdrawal) of the sun is an antecedent
with which the dew (or the freezing) is connected, and on
which it depends; it is part of the ground and reason why
the dew falls (or the lakes freeze) then rather than at other
times; although the absence (or withdrawal) of the sun is not
something positive and has no positive influence.
I should further point out that when I speak of connection
of causes and effects, I am talking about •moral causes [see

using ‘contingent’ not in what he has called its ordinary-language sense
but rather in the special sense that philosophers have invented for it.
See page 12. When he writes that it is ‘certainly implied in the Arminian
notion of liberty of will’ that all free actions are ‘contingent’ in this sense,
he is presumably relying on his view that if x is caused it is necessitated
by something that is necessary (because securely lodged in the past or
present), which means that x itself is necessitated and so isn’t ‘free’ in
any Arminian sense. After discussing the ‘contingency’ claim through
sections 3 and 4, he will start 5 by saying, in effect, that the claim was

### Section 6: What determines the will in cases where the mind sees the options as perfectly indifferent?

the mind sees the options as perfectly indifferent?
Some believers in the self-determining power ·of the will· say
that the view is strongly supported by a kind of experience
we all have (according to them), namely the experience of
being able to determine our wills at times when no prevailing
motive is presented to our minds. [See note on ‘determine’ on

•has a preference at the same time that it •has no preference.

of itself. The very act of •choosing one thing over another is
•preferring that thing, which is •setting a higher value on it.
It is not the case that the mind sets a higher value on one
thing than on another as a result of setting a higher value
on that thing!
[Edwards devotes about two more pages to (i) more quotations showing that Watts really does have the view that
Edwards is here attacking, and (ii) developing his reasons
for rejecting the view as impossible. Here is a bit of (i),
linked to the core of (ii):] Speaking of the case where none
of the courses of action presented for choice is fitter to
be chosen than the others, Watts writes: ‘In such a case
the will must act by its own choice and determine itself
as it pleases.’ He is supposing that the very determination
that is the basis and impetus for the will’s act is an act
of choice and pleasure, in which one act is more agreeable
than another: and this preference and greater pleasure is
the basis for all that the will does in this case. So the mind
is not indifferent when it determines itself, but prefers to
do one thing rather than another. [Edwards writes ‘. . . but had
rather do one thing than another’. The italics are his.] So the will
does not act in indifference. . . . Perhaps it is possible for the
•understanding to act in indifference, but surely the •will
never do so, because the will’s beginning to act is the same
thing as its beginning to choose or prefer. . . .
(2) It’s not very hard to show, with regard to the sorts
of cases Watts presents, not only •that in them the mind
must be influenced in its choice by something that has an
outweighing influence on it, but also •how this happens. All
that is needed to clear up this matter is a little attention to
our own experience and some clear thinking about the acts
of our own minds in such cases. Consider this case:
I am confronted by an empty chess-board. For some
reason I am resolved to put my finger on one square of

·You might want to challenge ‘at the same time’, but I am
right to include it·. If Watts had meant only that the mind is
indifferent before it comes to have a choice, or until it has a
preference, he wouldn’t have thought he was engaged in a
controversy. And anyway it isn’t what he meant: it is pretty
clear that what he is supposing is not that
the will chooses x rather than y, having been indifferent between them before making that choice,
but rather that
the will is indifferent between x and y when it chooses;
and it stops being indifferent between them only
afterwards, as a result of its choice. . . .
Here is what he says:
Where the courses of action that are proposed appear
equally fit or good, the will is left without a guide or
director; so it has to make its own choice by its own
determination, ·which it can do· because it is strictly
speaking a self -determining power. In such a case,
what the will does is (as it were) to make a good to
itself by its own choice, i. e. create its own pleasure or
delight in this self-chosen good. This is analogous to
someone who seizes a patch of unoccupied land in an
uninhabited country, makes it his own possession and
property, and rejoices in it as such. Where things were
previously indifferent, the will finds nothing to make
one agreeable than another, when they are considered
merely in themselves, but the pleasure it feels arising
from the choice it has made and carried through with.
We love many things that we have chosen, purely
because we chose them.
He can’t have been thinking hard when he wrote this! Choice
or preference can’t be before itself either temporally or
causally; it can’t be the basis for itself or a consequence

the board, without having decided which square it will
be—perhaps my employer has ordered me to do this, or a
friend has asked me to do so. Not being confined to or steered
towards any one square in particular, and finding nothing in
the squares—considered in themselves—that recommends
any one of the sixty-four over the others, my mind determines
to give itself up to what is commonly called ‘accident’,2 by
resolving to touch whatever square
happens to be most in view,
happens to catch my eye at that moment,
happens to be most in my mind, or
has my attention on it through some other such accident.
Here the mind takes three steps, though they can all be
performed seemingly instantaneously.
1. It forms a •general resolve to touch one of the squares.
2. It forms a second •general resolve, namely to let itself
be led to whatever individual square is made salient
by some accident such as those listed above.
3. Finally, it makes a •particular decision to touch a
certain individual square; the one that the mind lands
on through that sort of accident does now offer itself
in preference to the others.
Now, it is obvious that in each of those three steps the
mind is proceeding not in absolute indifference but under
the influence of an outweighing inducement. It takes step
1 because of an order or request or for some other reason.
It takes step 2—i.e. resolving to pick whatever square accidentally becomes salient—because it seems at that time to
be a convenient way of doing what is needed to fulfill the
general purpose resolved on in step 1. Then in step 3 the



### Section 7: The view that freedom of the will consists in indifference

‘objects’. Already in this work he has sometimes used ‘object’ in this very
general way, and the present version has usually replaced it by ‘action’.
Edwards is not confused about this; it’s just that the narrower sense of

What I have said in section 6 has gone some way to showing
the absurdity of the opinion that
•liberty consists in indifference, or in the equilibrium
that clears the will of any antecedent bias; •when the
indifferent will chooses one way rather than another, it
does this entirely from itself, exercising its own power

‘object’, which he is following here in order to make a good philosophical

Even if the objects appear
equal, the mind doesn’t have to make any choice between
them; what it has to choose is an external action relating
to the objects—taking one, touching one, etc.—and these
possible actions may not appear equal, so that one can be
point, is really our only sense for it.]


and the sovereignty that it has over itself.3
But this view has been around for so long, and has been
so generally accepted and so strenuously insisted on by
Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Jesuits, Socinians, Arminians,
and others, that it may deserve a fuller consideration. So I
shall now proceed to a more detailed and thorough inquiry
into it.
·A SUPPOSED REFINEMENT·
[To guard himself against accusations of misrepresenting
his opponents, Edwards now devotes a page to a fairly recent
minority view about what kind of indifference is essential
to liberty. It is the view that what liberty involves is not
indifference ·or equilibrium· in the will’s •inclinations or
•tendencies, but rather indifference ·or equilibrium· in the
soul’s •power of willing—meaning that the will so far as its
power or ability to choose goes can go either way. This is
offered as a refinement of the ‘indifference’ theory of freedom,
Edwards says, but he can’t find any sense in it that doesn’t
make it collapse back into the more familiar form of the
theory. Then:]
But I needn’t go on about the inexplicable abstruseness
of this ·equilibrium-of-power· idea. All I need is this:
Any Arminians who talk in any way about indifference
as essential to liberty of will, if they mean something
that is relevant to their over-all system, must be
talking about an indifference that leaves the will in a
state of being not yet determined, but free from actual



### Section 8: The view that freedom of the will rules out every kind of necessity

out every kind of necessity
Arminians in this controversy lay great stress on their thesis
that it is essential to human liberty that volitions or acts of
the will are contingent events—understanding contingency as
opposite not only to constraint but to all necessity. Because
it is emphasized so much, I want to look closely into this.
Two questions arise. •Is there—can there be—any such
thing as a volition that is ‘contingent’ in the sense of having
no infallible connection with anything that happened previously? •If there were such a thing, would this be any help to
the cause of liberty? ·I shall devote this section to the first
question. The second will come up in section 13·.
Could any volition occur contingently in this manner?
Bear in mind what I have already shown, namely that
nothing can ever happen without a cause or a reason why it
occurs thus rather than so, and I have especially produced
evidence for this in connection with acts of the will. If that is
right, then the acts of the will are never ‘contingent’ in the
sense of ‘not necessary’, because anything that has a cause
or reason must be ·necessarily· connected with its cause.
Here are three reasons for saying this.
(1) For something to have a cause and ground of its
existence and yet not to be connected with its cause is
an inconsistency. If it isn’t connected with the cause, it



### Section 9: How acts of the will connect with dictates of the understanding

I have probably made this matter so plain that there is
no point in reasoning about it any further, but I shall add
just one more point. It is that in the supposed case we are
discussing, the ‘cause’ isn’t really a cause at all, because its
power and influence have turned out not to be sufficient to
produce such an effect, and if it isn’t sufficient to produce it
then it doesn’t produce it. . . . Something that isn’t sufficient
to produce x at one time can’t be sufficient to produce it
at another time when the causally relevant circumstances
are exactly the same. So even in a case where x does follow
y, it doesn’t do so because of y as its cause. You might
try to get around this by supposing that the difference of
time is a causally relevant circumstance; but that conflicts
with the stipulation that y is the cause. ·Anyway, no-one
thinks that mere difference of time is causally relevant, and
that suggests yet another argument against the view I am
attacking here·. If mere difference of time has no causal
influence, then obviously the statement

It is clear that no acts of the will are contingent in the
sense of being entirely without necessity—i.e. of not being
necessary consequences of anything else to which they are
connected—because every act of the •will is connected in
some way with the •understanding. How? Well, each act of
the will is shaped by the greatest apparent good in a way
that I have already explained, namely: the soul always wills
or chooses whatever appears most agreeable to it, given the
mind’s present view of the whole situation. . . . Nothing is
more evident than that when men act voluntarily, doing
‘what they please’, they do what appears most agreeable to
them. To deny this would be tantamount to saying that
men don’t choose what appears to suit them best or what
seems most pleasing to them; or that they don’t •choose what
they •prefer—which is a contradiction. ·In those remarks,
the understanding comes in through the expressions ‘what
appears. . . ’, and ‘the mind’s present view’·.
Because it is so obvious that the acts of the will have some
connection with the dictates or views of the understanding,
this is accepted by some of the main Arminian writers,
particularly Whitby [see page 29] and Samuel Clarke. And
George Turnbull accepts it too, although he is a great enemy
to the doctrine of necessity. In his work The Principles of
Moral and Christian Philosophy he approvingly cites another
(‘excellent’) philosopher as sharing his view about this, in
these words:
No man sets himself to do anything without having
some view that serves him as a reason for what he is
doing; and whatever faculties he employs, it is always
the understanding that leads the way, shining whatever light it has; and all the soul’s operative powers

y was sufficient to produce x at T1 and not sufficient
to produce it at T2
is as absurd as the statement
y was sufficient to produce x at T1 and not sufficient
to produce it at T1 .
Summing up: It is obvious that every effect has a necessary
connection with its cause, i.e. with whatever is the true
ground of and reason for its existence. Thus, if there is no
event without a cause—as I proved earlier—then no event
whatever is contingent in the way that Arminians suppose
the free acts of the will to be contingent.



### Section 10: Volition necessarily connected with the influence of motives; criticisms of Chubb's doctrines and arguments concerning freedom of the will

the influence of motives; criticisms of Chubb’s doctrines and arguments concerning freedom of the
will
We have reached the conclusion that every act of the will
•has some cause,
and therefore (as I have proved)
•has a necessary connection with its cause,
and therefore
•is necessary by a necessity of connection and consequence.
Something that clearly brings out the truth of this conclusion
is the fact that every act of the will is aroused by some
motive. Here’s a consideration that makes it obvious that


many ways, ·of which I shall pick out five·.


[Edwards adds a further paragraph pointing out that on
Chubb’s theory the notion of what is prior or ‘previous’ comes
unstuck: a volition is influenced by a prior motive which gets
its influence from the prior occurrence of that volition.]
(2) In line with the inconsistent notion of the will ·that I
have been criticizing·,. . . . Chubb frequently calls motives
and arousals of the will to action ‘the passive ground or
reason of that action’. A remarkable phrase! I don’t think
there’s anything more unintelligible and empty of clear and
consistent meaning in all the writings of Duns Scotus or
Thomas Aquinas. [This is said in contempt for those famous scholastic philosophers.] [Edwards devotes two pages to discussing
things that Chubb might have meant by ‘passive ground
etc.’, shooting each one down. The discussion brings great
analytic competence to bear on a topic that doesn’t deserve
it.]
(3) Although Chubb asserts that every volition has some
motive, and that ‘in the nature of the thing no volition can
take place without some motive to induce it’, he says that
volition doesn’t always follow the strongest motive. . . . Here
are his words:
Though with regard to •physical causes the strongest
always prevails, it is otherwise with regard to •moral
causes. With them, sometimes the stronger prevails
but sometimes the weaker. It’s clear why there is
this difference: it is because what we call ‘moral
causes’ are strictly speaking not causes at all, but
merely passive reasons for or arousals to the action
in question—arousals that we have power to (or are
at liberty to) comply with or reject, as I have showed
above.
And so throughout the paragraph he uses various phrases
in insisting that the will isn’t always determined by the
strongest motive. (That is, by the motive that is strongest

(1) Chubb asserts over and over again that the will in

all its acts is influenced by motive and arousal; and that
this is always the prior ground of and reason for all its acts.
[Edwards supports this with quotations from Chubb. Then:]
And yet according to his theory what enables the influence of
motives to arouse us to action and to be actually a ground of
volition is the mind’s volition or choice that they should do
so. He loudly insists that in all free actions the mind doesn’t
have the volitions that motives arouse until it chooses to
do so. It chooses whether to go along with the motive that
presents itself to the mind; and when various motives are
presented, it chooses which it will give way to and which it
will reject. ‘Every man has power to act or to refrain from
acting agreeably with or contrary to any motive that presents
itself.’ [Edwards quotes two more passages to the same effect,
says there are many others, and continues:]
Now how can these things hang together? How can the
mind first act, and by its act of volition and choice determine
what motives are to be the ground of and reason for its
volition and choice? Chubb’s account implies that the choice
is already made before the motive has its effect, and that
the volition is already performed before the motive prevails
so as actually to be the ground of the volition—so that one
motive’s coming out top is a consequence of the volition
of which that same motive is the ground! If the mind has
already chosen to comply with a particular motive and to
consent to being aroused by it, the arousal arrives too late
and has no more work to do. . . . ·In the picture that Chubb
draws for us·, the son enters the scene before the father who
begets him: the choice is supposed to be the ground for the
motive’s influence, yet that same influence is supposed to be
the ground for the choice. . . .


prior to the volition itself. If we absurdly used ‘strongest’ to
mean ‘actually prevailing’, defining the strongest motive as
the one that is acted on, then of course, as Chubb points out,
it is trivially true that the strongest motive always prevails.)
In other parts of his work he says repeatedly that the will
is not determined by any superior strength or advantage
that motives have from any constitution or state of things
or any circumstances whatsoever previous to the actual
determination of the will. His whole discussion of human
liberty implies this; his whole theory is based on it.
But these claims can’t all be right. Before a choice is
made, the relevant motives vary in how strong they are.
Chubb ·rightly· supposes that the motives ‘invite’, ‘induce’,
‘arouse’, and ‘dispose the mind to action’. This implies that
the motives have in themselves something that is inviting,
some tendency to induce and dispose the mind to volition.
And if they have in themselves this nature and tendency, no
doubt they have it in different degrees, some greater and
some less. And the ones that have most of this tendency,
considered with all their nature and circumstances prior to
the volition, are the strongest motives, and those that have
least are the weakest motives.
Now, ·we are invited to believe that· •volition sometimes
doesn’t follow the motive that is strongest, i.e. has the most
previous tendency or advantage (all things considered) to
induce or arouse •it, but follows the weakest motive, the
one which, as it stands previously in the mind’s view, has
least tendency to induce •it. If that ever happens, it will be
a case in which the will apparently acts wholly without
motive, without any previous reason to dispose the mind
to it; and this is contrary to what Chubb thinks is the case.
What act is this? It is the act of preferring the weakest
motive. [Edwards argues ingeniously and at length for his
view that Chubb must say that there is no reason or motive



### Section 11: The evidence that God has certain foreknowledge of the volitions of moral agents

foreknowledge of the volitions of moral agents
In this section I shall defend the thesis that
•God has certain foreknowledge of acts of the wills of
moral agents,
and in the next section I shall defend the inference from that
premise to the conclusion that
•The volitions of moral agents are not contingent, i.e.
are necessary consequences of prior events.
You might think that there isn’t any need to argue in defence of that premise when addressing oneself to people
who profess to be Christians, but there is! There have
been—especially in recent times—people who claim to believe
that the Bible is the word of God yet deny that God has
certain foreknowledge of the free acts of moral agents. So
I shall consider the case for such foreknowledge on God’s
part, doing this as fully as the designed limits of this book
will permit; assuming throughout that I am talking to people
who accept the truth of the Bible.
My first argument [the second begins on page 50] is based on
God’s prediction of the acts of moral agents. My handling of
this matter will have two axioms in the background:
·The need-to-know axiom ·: If God doesn’t •foreknow
these events then he can’t •peremptorily and certainly


foretell them. If he has merely an uncertain guess
concerning events of this kind, then an uncertain
guess is all he can declare. To predict something in a
positive manner is to imply a claim to know about it
in advance.
·The scope axiom ·: If God doesn’t certainly foreknow
the •future volitions of moral agents then he can’t certainly foreknow •events that depend on those volitions
either. The only way to foreknow those dependent
events is through foreknowledge of the volitions on
which they depend, and the former knowledge can’t
be more certain than the latter.
Let the consequences of the volitions of moral agents be as
large, numerous and widespread as you like, making series
of differences that multiply as they branch off, with each
series running all through the universe and continuing to all
eternity; God must be as ignorant of all these infinitely many
consequences as he is of the volition that started them off.
That whole state of things—however important and extensive
it is, must be hidden from him ·if he can’t foreknow the
volitions of moral agents·.
I don’t think anyone will deny either of those two axioms,
so I now proceed to point out certain facts.
(1) Men’s moral conduct and qualities, their virtues and
vices, their wickedness and good practice—things rewardable
and punishable—have often been foretold by God. Pharaoh’s
moral conduct in refusing to obey God’s command to let his
people go was foretold. God said to Moses: ‘I am sure that
the king of Egypt will not let you go.’ (Exodus 3:19) Here
God professes not only to guess at but to know Pharaoh’s
future disobedience. [Edwards adds a long series of further
examples from the old and new testaments.]
(2) Many events have been foretold by God that depend on
the moral conduct of particular people, being brought about



### Section 12: God can't have certain foreknowledge of the future volitions of moral agents if they are contingent in a way that excludes all necessity

of the future volitions of moral agents if they are
contingent in a way that excludes all necessity
Having proved that God has a certain and infallible foreknowledge of the voluntary acts of moral agents, I now
embark on showing that it follows from this that these events
are necessary with a necessity of connection or consequence.
·This will complete the inference presented at the start of
section 11· [page 47].
So far as I have been able to discover, the leading
Arminian theologians deny that this follows, and affirm
that such foreknowledge is not evidence that the foreknown
event is in any way necessary. Let us go into this question
thoroughly and in detail. I can’t help thinking that the right
answer can be discovered by careful thought.
As an aid to having this matter properly considered, I
offer three major points.

(2) I shall prove that no future event can be certainly
foreknown if its occurrence is contingent and without any
necessity. [Edwards could validly infer this from his previous point, by



### Section 13: Even if the volitions of moral agents are not connected with anything antecedent, they must be 'necessary' in a sense that overthrows Arminian liberty

are not connected with anything antecedent, they
must be ‘necessary’ in a sense that overthrows
Arminian liberty
Suppose some act x of the will has a cause. Then I have
shown that x is not contingent but necessary, because it
is an effect that is necessarily dependent and consequent
on its cause, whatever that may be. If the cause is the will
itself, by antecedent acts of choosing and determining, x
must be a necessary effect ·of those previous acts·. The act
x—a determined effect of the previous cause—can’t prevent
the effectiveness of its cause; it has to be wholly subject to
its determination and command, as much as movements
of the limbs are. The consequent commanded acts of the
will are as passive and as necessary, with respect to the
previous determining acts, as the parts of the body are
with respect to the volitions that determine and command
them. Therefore, if all the •free acts of the will are like this,


the case. And supposing that
•x could have been otherwise if its cause had ordered
it otherwise
conflicts with its not having any cause or orderer [Edwards’s
phrase]. Anything that doesn’t depend on any free act of the
soul is necessary so far as the soul is concerned; and the
volition x we are discussing here doesn’t depend on anything
and isn’t connected with anything; so it doesn’t depend on
any free act of the soul, ·and is therefore necessary so far as
the soul is concerned·. It comes to the soul by accident, and
the soul is necessarily subjected to it (just as the passive
earth is necessarily subjected to whatever falls upon it). This
conflicts with the Arminian notion of liberty as the will’s
power of determining itself in its own acts, being •wholly
active in this, •with no passiveness and •with no subjection
to necessity. Thus, contingency is required by the Arminian
notion of liberty and yet is inconsistent with it.
This is a good place to call attention to something that
Watts wrote in his Essay on the Freedom of Will in God and
in Creatures etc.:
The word ‘chance’ always means something done
without design. Chance and design stand in direct
opposition to each other; and ‘chance’ can never be
properly applied to acts of the will. That is because
the will is the source of all design; whatever it chooses
it designs to choose, whether or not the choice is a
good one; and when it is confronted with a need to
choose between two perfectly equal things, it designs
to set itself onto one of the two, merely because it will.
Watts seems to have been very careless here. For if ‘the will
is the •source of all design’, as he says it is, then certainly it
isn’t always the •effect of design; there must be some acts of
the will that occur without having been designed, and those
acts must happen by chance, according to his definition of

## Part 3: The kind of liberty of will that Arminians believe in: is it necessary for moral agency, virtue and vice, praise and dispraise etc.?

### Section 1: God's moral excellence is necessary, yet virtuous and praiseworthy

virtuous and praiseworthy

the result is this: The infinitely holy God used to be thought
of by his people, and is described all through the Bible, as a
being who
•is virtuous,
•has all possible virtue,
•has every virtue in the most absolute purity and
perfection, and in a way that is infinitely brighter
and more lovable than in any creature,
•is the most perfect pattern of virtue, from whom all
the virtue of others is merely beams from the sun, and
•is, because of his virtue and holiness, infinitely more
worthy to be esteemed, loved, honoured, admired,
commended, extolled, and praised than any creature.
But this being, according to the views of Whitby and other
Arminians, has no virtue at all! When ‘virtue’ is ascribed
to him, it is merely an empty name. He doesn’t deserve
commendation or praise; he is under necessity, and so he
can’t avoid being as holy and good as he is; therefore no
thanks to him for that! It seems that God’s holiness, justice,
faithfulness, etc. mustn’t be thought of as being virtuous and
praiseworthy. The Arminians won’t deny that these features
of God are good; but we must understand that they are
no more commendable than are other goods in things that
aren’t moral agents; the sun’s brightness and the earth’s
fertility are good, but they aren’t virtuous, because these
properties are necessary to those bodies and don’t come
from any self-determining power.
Talking to Christians acquainted with the Bible, all that
is needed to refute this view of God is to state it in detail, ·as
I have just done·. I could set out scriptural texts in which

At the start of Part 2, I announced two inquiries: •into
whether any such thing as Arminian freedom ever did, does,
or can exist; and •into whether anything like Arminian liberty
is required for moral agency, virtue and vice, praise and
blame, reward and punishment, etc. Having finished with
the first inquiry, I now turn to the second.
Let us start by considering the virtue and agency of ·God·,
the supreme moral agent and fountain of all agency and
virtue. Whitby in his Five Points of Calvinism writes:
If all human actions are necessary, ‘virtue’ and ‘vice’
must be empty names, because we can’t do anything
that deserves blame or praise; for who can blame a
person merely for doing something he couldn’t help
doing? or judge that he deserves praise merely for
doing something he couldn’t avoid doing?
He says countless things along the same lines, especially in
the part of his book that deals with freedom of the will. He
steadily maintains that a freedom not only from compulsion
but from necessity is absolutely required if an action is to be
worthy of blame or deserving of praise. And we all know that
most Arminian writers these days agree with this, holding
that there is no virtue or vice, reward or punishment, nothing
to be commended or blamed, without this freedom. And yet
Whitby allows that God does not have this freedom; and the
Arminian writers that I have read generally agree that God is
necessarily holy, and that his will is necessarily determined
to that which is good. When these two views are put together,

God is represented as being—in every respect and in the
highest manner—virtuous and supremely praiseworthy; but
there would be no end to them, and there is no need to do
this for readers who have been brought up in the light of the
gospel.
It’s a pity that Whitby and other theologians of the same
sort didn’t explain themselves when they said that nothing
that is necessary deserves praise, while also saying that
God’s perfection is necessary, thereby implying that God
doesn’t deserve praise. If their words have any meaning at
all, they must be using ‘praise’ to mean the expression—in
language or otherwise—of some sorts of esteem, respect, or
honourable regard. Will they then say that •men’s small
and imperfect virtue makes them worthy of the esteem,
respect, and honour that God is not worthy of for his infinite
righteousness, holiness, and goodness? If so it must be
because of some sort of special excellence in the virtuous
man, something that puts him in a certain way above God,
something that he doesn’t get from God. [Edwards goes
on at some length mocking this idea—for example, asking
what name we should give to this special excellence, given
that all the best-sounding names have already been given to
God—and then he drops it.]
Whitby’s work clearly implies that the •necessity of God’s
moral perfections and actions is as inconsistent with his
being worthy of praise as is •necessity of compulsion. If
that is right, why should we thank God for his goodness,
any more than we would if he were forced to be good, or
any more than we would thank one of our fellow-creatures
who did us good not freely and of good will or from any
kindness of heart, but from mere compulsion? Arminians
take God to be necessarily a good and gracious being; for
this is the basis for some of their main arguments against
many Calvinist doctrines. They say that those doctrines are



### Section 2: The acts of the will of Jesus Christ's human soul were necessarily holy, yet truly virtuous, praiseworthy, rewardable etc.

praiseworthy, rewardable etc.
I have already considered Whitby’s insistence that a freedom
not only from compulsion but also from necessity is required
for virtue or vice, praise or dispraise, reward or punishment.
He also insists on the same freedom as absolutely required

for •a person to be subject to a law of precepts or prohibitions,
for •promises and threats, and for •a state of trial. [Edwards
backs up these three claims about Whitby’s views with a total
of 19 references to pages in Whitby’s book.—-A ‘state of trial’
is a course of events in which someone’s courage, resolution,
strength, honesty etc. are tested, the implication being that
the test is hard to pass. Whitby’s thesis was, presumably,
that if the person lacks Arminian freedom his conduct in
the test can go only one way, so that what’s going on isn’t
really a test. In item (xi) on page 64 Edwards suggests a
near-equation of ‘trial’ with ‘temptation’, a suggestion that
appears even more strongly at the end of this section.]
With these claims in mind, let us look into the moral
conduct of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he exhibited in his
human nature in his humble state as a man. ·In this section·,
I will show first that Jesus’ holy behaviour was necessary, i.e.
that it was impossible for him to conduct himself otherwise
than in a holy manner, otherwise than being perfectly holy
in every single act of his life. And secondly that his holy
behaviour was strictly speaking virtuous, and worthy of
praise; and that he was •subject to law and commands,
•subject to promises and rewards, and •in a state of trial.
(1) It was impossible that the volitions of Christ’s human
soul should ever, in any circumstance, differ even slightly
from what is holy and agreeable to God’s nature and will.
The following ·eleven· things make this evident.
(i) God had promised to preserve and uphold Jesus. . . .through his Spirit, under all Jesus’ temptations, so
effectively that he could not fail to achieve the end for which
he came into the world; but he would have failed if he had
fallen into sin. [Edwards devotes nearly two pages to biblical
citations backing this up.]
(ii) The same thing is evident from all the promises God
made to the Messiah regarding his future glory, kingdom

alterations in the soul—count as obedient or disobedient only
indirectly, being connected by an established law of nature to
the state or actions of the will. It is clear, then, that demands
may be made on the will itself; and the most proper, direct,
and immediate subject of command is the being of a good
will. [That is Edwards’s phrase. He means ‘the existence of a good will’,

Arminian writers heavily insist that necessity is inconsistent
with law or command. More specifically, they hold that it is
absurd to suppose that God by his command should require
men to do things they are unable to do—and in this context
no distinction is made between natural inability and moral
inability. So I now want to look into this question in detail.
In the interests of clarity, I shall break up what I want to
say into three distinct parts. ·They will be the sole topic of
this section·.
·C OMMANDS ARE ADDRESSED DIRECTLY ONLY TO THE WILL·
(1) A precept or command can be aimed at the will itself
and not only at actions that are the effects of the will. What is
required of a man by such a command is a certain state of or
action by his will, not merely a certain alteration in the state
of his body or his mind resulting from a volition. This is very
obvious; for it is only the soul that is properly and directly the
subject of precepts or commands, for it is only the soul that
is capable of receiving or perceiving commands. The motions
or state of the body are •commandable only to the extent
that they are •subject to the soul and •connected with its
acts. And the will is the only faculty the soul has by which it
can in the strictest sense consent to, yield to, or comply with
any command. It is only through the will that the soul can
directly disobey, or refuse to comply; because consenting,
yielding, accepting, complying, refusing, rejecting, etc. are—
by the very meanings of the terms—nothing but certain acts
of the will. Obedience, in its basic nature, is the submitting
and yielding of the will of one person to the will of another.
Disobedience is the will’s not consenting to, or not complying
with, the proclaimed will of the commander. Acts that are not
the acts of the will—such as certain bodily movements and

so that his topic is just the will’s being good; the command in question is
‘Be good!’, addressed to someone’s will.] If that can’t be prescribed

or required by a command or precept, nothing can; for the
only way anything else can be required is through its being
the product of a good will.
Corollary 1: If there is a series of acts of the will, with each
act after the first being determined by the one that preceded
it, the first act in the series—the determining act—is properly
the subject of command, and not merely the consequent acts
that depend on it. . . . This first act is what determines the
whole affair: the obedience or disobedience lies in the first
act in a special way, because the consequent acts are all
governed and determined by it. If this governing act isn’t
the proper object of the command, then no act is. [Edwards
has been talking about a linked series of acts of the will, or volitions, V1 ,
V2 , V3 ,. . . with special attention to V1 , the ‘first act that determines the
whole affair’. He is now going to talk about an act of the soul—let’s call
it PV, for ‘prior to volition’—that precedes and kicks off the entire series.
Notice: an act of the soul, not of the will. The series that PV belongs to is
PV, V1 , V2 , V3 ,. . . ]

Corollary 2: It also follows from what I have said that if
the soul acts or exerts itself in any way prior to any free act
of choice that might direct and determine the acts of the will,
such an act PV of the soul can’t properly be subject in any
way to any command or precept whatsoever—neither directly
nor indirectly, neither immediately nor remotely. Because
PV occurs prior to all acts of the will, it can’t •involve consent
or obedience to any command, nor can it •be an effect of


acts that did involve consent or obedience. If you tried to
talk about PV in terms of (dis)obedience, it would be an act
of (dis)obedience in which the will has no concern at all; it
would be wholly involuntary, with no willing obedience or
rebellion—no compliance or opposition of the will—and what
sort of obedience or rebellion is that?
Now, the Arminians think of freedom of the will as
consisting in the soul’s determining its own acts of will.
And what emerges from what I’ve just been saying is that
this kind of ‘freedom of the will’, instead of being •essential
to moral agency and to men’s being the subjects of moral
government, is •utterly inconsistent with it. For if the soul
determines all its acts of will, it does so by means of acts like
PV—ones that are not themselves acts of will or of choice,
and don’t come within the scope of any command or moral
government. So any •acts of the will that depend on PV
can’t be the subjects of command either, because •they are
necessary consequences of PV, which is not subject to any
command. And the person can’t be the subject of command
or government in respect of his external [= ‘ physical’, ‘bodily’]
actions, because they—as necessary effects of the acts of the
will—are all necessary too. So this Arminian theory implies
that mankind are subjects of command or moral government
in nothing at all; all their moral agency is entirely excluded
from moral government, and no room is left for virtue or vice.
So it is the Arminian theory, and not that of the Calvinists,
that is utterly inconsistent with moral government and with
all use of laws, precepts, prohibitions, promises, or threats.
And there is no possible way to make the Arminian principles
consistent with these things. Someone might try:
•‘There is ·no act PV·, no prior determining act of the
soul prior to all the acts of the will. Rather, volitions
are events that happen by pure accident, without any
determining cause.



### Section 5: A close look at the sincerity of desires and attempts, which is supposed to excuse the non-performance of things that are good in themselves

and attempts, which is supposed to excuse the nonperformance of things that are good in themselves
Many writers have urged the following claim:
Someone who isn’t able to perform spiritual duties—
such as repentance for sin, love to God, a warm
acceptance of Christ as exhibited and offered in the
gospel, etc.—may sincerely want to do these things


time. And a second point: what •they aim at is not—now or
ever—those good volitions themselves but rather something
else altogether. ·I shall explain this through an analogous
case·:
Consider a drunkard who continues in his drunkenness because he •has a violent appetite for strong
drink and no love for virtue, but who •is very tight
with his money, which makes him •concerned and
upset by the lessening of his wealth and the prospect
of poverty. This man does in a way desire to have the
virtue of temperance; his present will is to gratify his
extravagant appetite, but he wishes he had a heart to
refrain from future acts of intemperance and to give up
his excesses—all because of his unwillingness to part
with his money. Yet he goes on with his drunkenness:
his wishes and attempts ·to give it up· are insufficient
and ineffective.
This man does not have any proper, direct, sincere willingness to give up this vice and the vicious deeds that go
with it; for when he continues with his excessive drinking
he is acting voluntarily. It is quite wrong to call his desire ‘a
willingness to be temperate’, because it’s not a true desire for
that virtue. His wishes don’t aim at that virtue, and have no
direct relation to it. The end-point of his desire is the saving
of his money or the avoiding of poverty—the desire’s strength
comes entirely from that. The virtue of temperance comes
into this only very indirectly; indeed it isn’t really right to say
that virtue is involved at all, even as a necessary means to
gratifying the vice of covetousness. Now:
Consider a man with an exceedingly corrupt and
wicked heart, who has no love for God and Jesus
Christ but on the contrary is greatly inclined to sins
of the flesh, and therefore thoroughly dislikes and
opposes the things of religion. This man comes from

## Part 4: Examining the main reasons the Arminians give for their view about liberty, moral agency etc. and against the opposite doctrine

### Section 1: What makes dispositions of the heart and acts of the will vicious or virtuous is not their cause but their nature

and acts of the will vicious or virtuous is not their
cause but their nature

to wriggle free from this difficulty. Edwards then launches a
different attack, aimed at the heart of the thesis in question
rather that at its consequences:]
The natural notions of mankind hold that moral
evil. . . .consists in •a certain ugliness in the nature of certain
dispositions of the heart and acts of the will, and not in
•the ugliness of something else that is supposed to be the
cause of it and that itself deserves abhorrence. The latter
view would be absurd, because it involves supposing that
something that is innocent and not evil is truly evil and faulty
because something else is evil! This implies a contradiction,
for it supposes that the very thing that is morally evil and
blameworthy is innocent and not blameworthy, and that
what is blameworthy is only its cause. To say that vice
doesn’t consist in the thing that is vicious but in its cause is
tantamount to saying that vice doesn’t consist in vice but in
what produces it.
It’s true that something may be blameworthy because
it causes vice; something’s producing wickedness may be a
wickedness in it. But then there are two wickednesses, not
one; the wicked act of the cause in producing wickedness is
•one wickedness, and the wickedness it produces is •another.
So the wickedness of the latter doesn’t lie in the former, but
is distinct from it; and the wickedness of both lies in the
evil •nature of the things that are wicked ·and not in their
•causes·. [The word ‘hateful’ used to mean ‘full of hate’, and still does

When Arminians defend their position, they rely on the
supposition that what makes a disposition or act of the
will virtuous is not its nature but rather its cause—·not
what it is like, but where it came from·. However good a
disposition or act may be in itself, if it isn’t caused by our
virtue there is nothing virtuous or praiseworthy in it; and,
on the other side, however bad a disposition or act may be
in itself, there is nothing vicious or blameworthy in it unless
it arises from something that is our vice or fault. That is
the basis for their grand objection ·to opposing views·, and
their claim to be able to demonstrate—or even to reveal as
self-evident—that no habits or acts of the will can be virtuous
and commendable, or vicious and blameworthy, unless they
come from some virtuous or vicious determination of the will
itself.
But if you think hard about this you’ll see that it is
altogether a mistake—indeed, a gross absurdity. . . .
If the essence of virtuousness or commendableness and of
viciousness or fault lies not in the •nature of the dispositions
and mental acts that are thus described but in their •cause,
then it certainly doesn’t lie anywhere! [Edwards devotes two
pages to elaborately defending this. The core of the defence is
fairly simple: if the moral status of an action depends purely
on the moral status of its cause, then the moral status of the
cause depends on the moral status of its cause, and so on
backward to infinity; and there is no way for the Arminian

in the USA. Its now-dominant sense in the rest of the English-speaking
world is ‘fit to be hated, liable to attract just hatred from others, deeply

What makes sin
hateful is whatever features it has that make it deserve
nasty’; and that’s what Edwards means by it.]


punishment (which is nothing but the expression of hatred).
And what makes virtue lovable is whatever features it has
that make it fit to receive praise and reward (which are
nothing but expressions of esteem and love). But what makes
vice hateful is its hateful •nature; and what makes virtue
lovable is its lovable •nature. According to the common sense
of mankind, the soul of virtue and vice is their worthiness
of esteem or disesteem, praise or dispraise; and what gives
them that worthiness is the beauty or ugliness that are
inherent in good or evil will, not in what causes it. If the
cause of the rise of a hateful disposition or act of will is itself
also hateful, that involves another prior evil ·act of· will; it
is entirely another sin and deserves punishment by itself,
evaluated in itself. . . .
For instance, ingratitude is hateful and worthy of dispraise according to common sense, not because it was
•caused by something as bad or worse, but because it is
hateful •in itself by its own inherent ugliness. Similarly, the
love of virtue is lovable and worthy of praise not because
something else happened first, causing this love of virtue to
enter our minds—for example, we chose to love virtue and
somehow or other got ourselves to love it—but because of the
·intrinsic· lovableness of such a disposition and inclination
of the heart. . . .
This may be a good place to comment on something
said by an author who has recently made a mighty noise
in America. [Edwards is referring to The Scripture-Doctrine of Original

### Section 4: 'Moral necessity is consistent with praise and blame, reward and punishment'—this squares with common sense and men's natural notions

praise and blame, reward and punishment’—this
squares with common sense and men’s natural notions

endeavours is the language in which it is talked about: the
expressions that are often used seem to imply •this. Such
words as ‘unable’, ‘unavoidable’, ‘impossible’, ‘irresistible’
carry, ·in their common-necessity sense·, a plain reference
to a possible power exerted, attempts made, resistance put
up, in opposition to the necessity; and anyone who hears
such expressions and doesn’t suspect that they are being
used in a non-standard way (to signify philosophical rather
than common necessity) will inevitably think that what’s
being talked about does involve true desires and attempts
that are blocked by some invincible necessity.

I have tried to explain why some people find it hard to reconcile with common sense the praising or blaming, rewarding or
punishing, of things that are morally necessary. Whether or
not my account of why they find the reconciliation •difficult
is satisfactory, I now undertake to satisfy you that the reconciliation is •right. When this matter is looked at properly,
and cleared of delusions arising from the impropriety and
ambiguity of terms, it emerges very clearly that the supposedly hard-to-reconcile items can be reconciled. The thesis
that blameworthiness etc. is compatible with moral inability
is perfectly consistent with •the ways of thinking that come
naturally to all mankind, •the sense of things that is found
everywhere in the common people who are furthest from
having their thoughts diverted from their natural channel by
metaphysical and philosophical subtleties. Indeed, it’s not
only consistent with those thoughts—it is outright dictated
by them.
(1) You’ll see this if you consider what the common notion
of blameworthiness is. It seems clear to me that common
people across the nations and down the centuries have
equated a person’s being at fault with •his being or doing
wrong when acting at his own will and pleasure, and •his
being wrong in what he wills or is pleased with. Or in other
words, perhaps making their notion clearer: they equate a
person’s being at fault with •his having his heart wrong, and
•his doing wrong from his heart. And that is the whole story.
The common people don’t rise to abstract reflections on the
metaphysical sources, relations, and dependencies of things,
in order to form their notion of faultiness or blameworthiness.

(5) Another thing that makes people readier to suppose

it to be unreasonable that men should be exposed to the
threatened punishments of sin for doing things that are
morally necessary, or not doing things that are morally
impossible, is that when the threatened punishment is very
great, the imagination strengthens the argument and adds
to the power and influence of the seeming reasons against it.
It’s not so hard to allow that men may be justly exposed to a
small punishment ·for doing something it was not morally
possible to avoid·. Not that size of punishment affects
the issue: if it were truly a dictate of reason that moral
necessity is inconsistent with faultiness or just punishment,
the demonstration of this would hold equally well for any
punishment; but although size of punishment doesn’t affect
the •argument, it does affect the •imagination. Those who
argue that it is unjust to damn men for things that are
morally necessary make their argument seem stronger by
using strong language to describe the severity of the punishment. They say, for example, that it isn’t just ‘that a man
should be cast into eternal fire, that he should be made to fry
in hell to all eternity, for things he had no power to avoid and
was under a fatal, unavoidable, unconquerable necessity of
doing.’ [The quotation-marks are Edwards’s; he gives no reference.]

They don’t, ·in forming their ideas of faultiness etc.·, wait
until they have refined their thought to the point where they
can answer the questions:
•What first determines the will?
•Is it determined by something extrinsic or something
intrinsic?
•Does volition determine volition?
•Does the understanding determine the will?
•Is there such a thing as metaphysicians mean by
‘contingency’ (if they mean anything)?
•Is there a strange inexplicable sovereignty in the will,
through which it brings about all its own sovereign
acts by means of its own sovereign acts?
They don’t get any part of their notion of fault or blame from
answers to any such questions as those. If the common
notion of fault did depend on such answers, 99.9
•moral evil of the sort I have described, namely someone’s willingly being wrong or doing wrong,
•resentment in others, and
•pain inflicted on the person in whom this moral evil
is.
This natural sense is what we call ‘conscience’.
It’s true that the common people and children, in their
notion of a faulty act by someone, do suppose that it is the
person’s own act. But this comes simply from their notion
of what he did or even what he chose to do. That notion of
theirs doesn’t include the idea of an event’s •causing itself
to occur, or of an event’s •occurring accidentally or with no
cause. [Edwards then repeats briefly why each of those leads
to absurdity.]
It’s also true that the common people in their notion of a
faulty or praiseworthy deed do suppose that the man does it
in the exercise of liberty. But their notion of liberty is merely
that someone’s having the opportunity to do as he pleases.



### Section 5: Two objections considered: the 'no use trying' objection and (-near the end-) the 'mere machines' objection

trying’ objection and (·near the end·) the ‘mere machines’ objection
[The above Section heading expresses the core of Edwards’s heading,
which is 33 words longer.] Arminians say that if it is true that

sin and virtue come about by a necessity that consists in
a sure connection of causes and effects, antecedents and
consequents, it can never be worth our while to try to avoid
sin and obtain virtue, because no efforts of ours can alter the
futurity of an outcome that has become necessary through
a connection already established. [The ‘futurity’ of an event (or
state of affairs) is its status as something that is going to happen (or be
the case).]

Let us look into this matter thoroughly. Let us examine
rigorously whether the thesis that events are necessarily


connected with their antecedents implies that attempts and
arrangements to avoid or obtain some future thing must be
in vain—or rather that they must be more in vain on that
supposition than on the supposition that events are not
necessarily connected with their antecedents.
An attempt is ‘in vain’ only if it is unsuccessful—i.e.
doesn’t lead eventually to the thing being aimed at. This
can happen only in one of these two ways:
•The means are used but the outcome aimed at doesn’t
follow.
•The means are used and the outcome follows, but its
doing so has nothing to do with those means; it would
have come about just as well if they hadn’t been used.
If either of these is the case, then the means are not properly
successful and are truly ‘in vain’.



### Section 6: The objection that the doctrine defended here agrees with Stoicism and with the opinions of Hobbes

are contrary to the natural sense and common reason of
mankind; but when the Stoics agree with us, that is a great
argument against us, showing our doctrine to be heathenish.
Some Calvinist writers have noted that the Arminians
agree with the Stoics in some of the doctrines in which they
are opposed by the Calvinists—especially in •their denying an
original, innate, total corruption and depravity of heart, and
in •what they held regarding man’s ability to make himself
truly virtuous and in harmony with God, and in •some other
doctrines.
Another point: ‘Calvinism agrees in some respects with
the doctrine of the ancient Stoic philosophers’ is no better
an argument against Calvinism than the following is against
Arminianism: in some of the Arminian doctrines in which
they differ from Calvinists, they agree in some respects
with •the doctrine of the Sadducees and Jesuits, and with
•the opinions of the very worst of the heathen philosophers,
namely the followers of Epicurus, that father of atheism and
licentiousness.
In order to know what is true about fate, I don’t need to
know precisely what the ancient Stoic philosophers thought
regarding it. (It’s not as though a sure way to be right about
something is to differ from the Stoics about it!) It seems that
they differed among themselves; and probably the doctrine
of fate as maintained by most of them was in some respects
wrong. But whatever their doctrine was,
•if any of them believed in a fate that is inconsistent with
any liberty consisting in our doing as we please, I utterly
deny such a fate.
•If they believed in a fate that isn’t consistent with the
common and universal notions mankind have of liberty,
activeness, moral agency, virtue, and vice, I disclaim any
such thing and think I have shown that the system I
defend has no such consequence.

When Calvinists oppose the Arminian notion of the freedom
of will and contingency of volition, and insist that every act
of the will—and every event of whatever kind—is attended
with some kind of necessity, their opponents cry out against
them that they are agreeing with the ancient Stoics in their
doctrine of fate and with Hobbes in his opinion of necessity.
It wouldn’t be worthwhile to answer such an irrelevant objection if it hadn’t been urged by some of the chief Arminian
writers. Many important truths were maintained by the
ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, and especially
by the Stoics; and they are not less true because those
philosophers held them! The Stoic philosophers, by the
general agreement of Christian theologians (even Arminian
ones), were the greatest, wisest, and most virtuous of all
the heathen philosophers; and in their doctrine and practice
they came the nearest to Christianity of any of their sects.
Their sayings often turn up in the writings and sermons even
of Arminian theologians, not to illustrate some falsehood but
rather in confirmation of some of the greatest truths of the
Christian religion—ones relating to the unity and perfections
of God, a future state, the duty and happiness of mankind
etc.—showing how the light of nature, and reason, in the
wisest and best of the heathen harmonize with and confirm
the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Although Whitby argues that the agreement of the Stoics
with us shows that our doctrine is false, yet he—this very
same Whitby—argues that some agreement of the Stoics with
the Arminians shows that their doctrine is true! When the
Stoics agree with the Arminians, this (it seems) confirms
their doctrine and refutes ours by showing that our opinions


•If by ‘fate’ the Stoics meant anything that could be thought



### Section 7: The necessity of God's will

Here is an objection that may be made against the position I
have been defending:
You say that the idea of a self-determining power in
the will is absurd and self-contradictory, and that it
must be the case that the will is determined in every
case by the motive which (as it stands in the view
of the understanding) is stronger that any motive for
acting differently. If you are right about this, it follows
that not only the will of created minds but the will of
God himself is necessary in all its determinations.
Watts in his Essay on the Freedom of Will in God and in Creatures has developed this objection in the following words:
What a strange doctrine this is, contrary to all our
ideas of the dominion of God! Doesn’t it destroy the
glory of his liberty of choice, and take away from
the world’s creator and governor and benefactor, that
most free and sovereign agent, all the glory of this
sort of freedom [presumably meaning: ‘the glory of the sort
of freedom that he actually has’]? Doesn’t it seem to make
God a kind of mechanical instrument of fate, and
introduce Hobbes’s doctrine of fatality and necessity
into everything that God is involved in? [For ‘fatality’,
see note on page 57.] Doesn’t it seem to represent the
blessed God as having vast understanding, as well as
power and effectiveness, but still to leave him without

a will to choose among all the ends that he might aim
at? In short, it seems to make the blessed God a sort
of almighty servant of fate, acting under its universal
and supreme influence—just as some of the ancients
maintained that fate was above the gods.
This is rhetoric rather than argument; it is addressed
to men’s imaginations and prejudices rather than to mere
reason. But I shall try, calmly, to see whether there is any
reason in this frightful picture that Watts draws.
·A PRELIMINARY POINT : THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS EXERCISE·
Before getting into that in detail, though, I should make
this preliminary point: When we are trying to speak or think
in terms of exact metaphysical truth, it is reasonable to
expect that we’ll find it much harder to do this when our
topic is
•the nature and manner of the existence of things in
God’s understanding and will, and the operation of
these faculties (if I may so call them) of God’s mind,
than it is when our topic is
•the human mind.
The human mind is infinitely more within our view ·than
God’s mind is·; and we are nearer to being able to think
and talk about it adequately, ·rather than falling infinitely
short of adequacy as we do when thinking and talking about
the mind of God. But even when our minds are the topic,
our language falls considerably short·. Language is indeed
very lacking in words to express precise truth about our own
minds and their faculties and operations. Words were first
formed to stand for external things; and the ones we apply
to internal and spiritual things are almost all borrowed from
the others and used in a sort of figurative sense. ·Think
for example of the sentence ‘I kept that at the back of my
mind’·. Because of this, most of them are very ambiguous
and unfixed in their meaning, giving rise to countless doubts,



### Section 8: Discussion of further objections against the moral necessity of God's volitions

the moral necessity of God’s volitions
As we saw, Watts accepts that •God, being perfectly wise,
will constantly and certainly choose what appears most
fit, in any case where there is an option that is fitter and
better than all the others, and that •it isn’t possible for
him to do otherwise. This is tantamount to agreeing that
in cases where there is any real preferableness, it is no
dishonour—nothing in any respect unworthy of God—for
him to act from necessity. . . . And if that is right, it follows
that if in all God’s choice-situations there is one option that
is better and fitter than any of the others, then it would not
be dishonorable or in any way unworthy or unsuitable for
God’s will to be necessarily determined in everything. If this
is granted, that’s the end of the argument from the premise
that such a necessity clashes with the liberty, supremacy,
independence, and glory of God. The argument now has
to turn on a completely different question, namely whether
there is always a best option in all God’s choice-situations.
Watts denies this; he thinks that in many cases there are
two or more different procedures that would further God’s
plans equally well—equal in their powers to get the result,
and equal in this intrinsic fitness. Let us see whether this is
evidently so.
The arguments brought to prove it are of two kinds. (1)
The premise is that in many instances we must suppose that
there is absolutely no difference between various possible


answer that ·the temporal part of· this argument is based on
a groundless fantasy, namely:
An infinite length of time before the world was created,
distinguished by successive parts, properly and truly;
or, ·in other words·,
A series of limited and measurable periods of time
before the world was created, the series being infinitely
long.
No! The eternal duration that was before the world ·began·
was only the eternity of God’s existence, and that is nothing
but his immediate, perfect, and invariable possession of
the whole of his unlimited life, all together and at once.
[Edwards then gives this in Latin; it is Boethius’s definition
of eternity.] This is so generally accepted that I needn’t stop
to demonstrate it.5
·The spatial part of· the argument presupposes an extent
of space beyond the limits of the created world, of an infinite
length, breadth, and depth, truly and properly distinguished
into different measurable parts, each with a beginning and
an end, one after another, in an infinite series. This notion of



### Section 9: The objection that the doctrine maintained here implies that God is the author of sin

The Arminians urge that the doctrine that men’s volitions are
necessary, i.e. necessarily connected with antecedent events
and circumstances, makes God the author of sin, because
he has constituted the states of things and the course of
events in such a way that sinful volitions become necessary
as a result of his decisions. Whitby, in his ‘Discourse on the
Freedom of the Will’ (in his Five points of Calvinism) quotes
one of the ancients as being on his side about this, declaring
that this opinion of the necessity of the will
absolves sinners, as doing nothing evil of their own
accord, and throws all the blame for all the wickedness committed in the world onto God and his


providence. . . ., whether he himself necessitated them
to do these things or ordered matters in such a way
that they were constrained by some other cause to do
them.
And Whitby says later on:
In the nature of the thing and in the opinion of the
philosophers, in things necessary the deficient cause
must be reduced to the efficient. [That is Whitby’s
translation of the Latin sentence that he first offers.
The meaning seems to be: if the occurrence of something is necessary, then •a negative cause of it is just
as relevant as a positive one, or •allowing it to happen
is just as significant as making it happen.] And in this
case it is easy to see why. It is because the not doing
what is required, or not avoiding what is forbidden,
being a defect, must follow from the position of the
necessary cause of that deficiency. [That ‘because’ clause



### Section 10: Sin's first entrance into the world

Things that I have already said may serve to solve or clear
away many of the objections that might be raised concerning
sin’s first coming into the world—I mean objections based
on the idea that my views imply that God must be the
author of the first sin through his so arranging things that
it •necessarily followed from his permission that the ·first·
sinful act should be committed, and so on. So I needn’t go
through it all again, repeating what I have already said about
such a •necessity’s not proving God to be the author of sin
in any bad sense or in any sense that would infringe any
liberty of man concerned in his moral agency or capacity for
blame, guilt, and punishment.
But there is another difficulty ·about God’s relation to the
first sin· that I haven’t yet confronted:
Let it be granted that it was right for God, after
making man, to order his circumstances in such a way
that from these circumstances, together with God’s
not giving any further help or providing any divine
influence, man’s sin would infallibly follow. But why
wouldn’t it have been just as good for God to make
man with a fixed prevailing source of sin in his heart,
right from the outset?
I answer that if sin was to come into existence and appear
in the world, it was appropriate that it should arise—and be
seen to arise—from the imperfection of the ·sinning· creature
as such, so as not to appear to have come from God as its
efficient cause. And this couldn’t have happened if man
had had sin in his heart from the outset. For it to happen,
the abiding source and habit of sin must have been first

introduced ·into the world· by an evil act on the part of
the creature. If sin hadn’t arisen from the imperfection of
the creature, it wouldn’t have been so visible that it didn’t
arise from God as its positive cause and real source. But to
consider fully all the difficulties that have been raised about
sin’s first entrance of sin into the world. would take more
space than I can give it here.
So, without purporting to deal with all the difficulties,
I merely make the general point that the Arminians are
not better placed to handle them than the Calvinists are.
Nothing that the Arminians say about the contingency or
self-determining power of man’s will is the least use in
explaining how the first sinful volition of mankind could take
place and how man could justly be blamed for it. To say that
the will was self-determined, or determined by free choice
in that sinful volition, is to say that the •first sinful volition
was determined by a •previous sinful volition—and that is
no solution of the difficulty! Nor is it any better solution to
say that the first sinful volition chose and determined and
produced itself —implying that it existed before it existed.
Nor will it help us over the difficulty to say the first sinful
volition arose accidentally, without any cause at all. (Like
answering the difficult question ‘How could the world be
made out of nothing?’ by saying ‘It came into existence out
of nothing without any cause’.) And even if we did allow that
the first evil volition could have arisen by perfect accident
without any cause, that wouldn’t lessen the difficulty about
God’s blaming man for it. . . .



### Section 11: A supposed inconsistency between these principles and God's moral character

these principles and God’s moral character
What I have already said may suffice to answer most of the
objections, and silence the loud protests, of Arminians who


it is not inconsistent with the sincerity of invitations and
advice (in the corollary at the end of that section [page 76]).
Indeed, I showed in Part 3, section 7, corollary 1 [page 87]
that this objection of Arminians concerning the sincerity of
divine urgings, invitations and advice demonstrably holds
against themselves. But ·I want to revisit that last topic,
which involves a difficulty that I haven’t so far discussed,
namely· the difficulty of reconciling •the sincerity of advice,
invitations, and persuasions with •a foreknown fixedness
of all ·future· events. This difficulty can’t reasonably be
brought against Calvinists as an objection to their not being Arminians, because the foreknowledge in question is
accepted not only by Calvinists but also by most Arminians,
who acknowledge the absolute foreknowledge of God. The
main seeming difficulty in the case is this:
When God advises, invites, and persuades, he makes
a show of aiming at, seeking, and trying for the thing
exhorted and persuaded to. But it’s impossible for a
thinking being truly to seek or try for something that
he at that time knows for sure won’t happen. . . .
Now, if God knows with utmost certainty and perfection ·that
the upshot in question won’t happen·, it makes no difference
·to the problem· how he gets this knowledge—whether it
is from the necessity that he sees in things, or in some
other way. Well, the Arminians allow that God has a certain
foreknowledge of all men’s sinful actions and omissions, so
they are in effect allowing that God’s inviting and persuading
men to do things which he at that time knows for sure that
they won’t do is not evidence of insincerity. As well as being
implicitly allowed by most Arminians, it must be allowed by
anyone who thinks that the scriptures are the word of God.
[Edwards backs this up with a page of quotations from the
old and new testaments.] So that whatever difficulty there
can be in this matter, it can’t count against my position as
