# Critique of Edwards

## Overview

Whedon directly refutes Edwards' attempt to link necessity (determinism) with human responsibility, arguing that if actions are necessitated, humans aren't truly responsible, and God can't justly hold them accountable. Whedon challenges Edwards' compatibilist position that moral responsibility can coexist with determinism, contending that Edwards' view reduces human agency to mere mechanical responses to the strongest motive, thereby eliminating genuine choice. He argues that Edwards' framework makes God the ultimate author of sin and evil, since all actions flow from divine determination, which undermines both human moral accountability and divine justice. Whedon maintains that Edwards' attempt to preserve responsibility while denying libertarian freedom creates an incoherent system that fails to justify God's governance or human culpability.

**Whedon's Method:** Whedon reverses Edwards' approach. While Edwards "was first to institute a psychological and logical investigation of the operations of the volitional faculty demonstrating its necessity in action, and then to bring the moral intuitions into accordance with the intellective conclusions," Whedon "has first assumed the prior validity of the intuitions, and then sought by their guidance to ascertain how our psychology and logic may be brought into harmony with their dicta." This methodological difference is crucial to understanding Whedon's critique.

## Defense of Libertarian Free Will

The book champions the idea that humans possess a genuine ability to choose between alternatives, even against strong inclinations, a concept Edwards rejected.

#### Argument 1: Incompatibility of Necessity and Responsibility
- **Chapter:** Part III, Chapter III, Chapter IX
- **Section:** The Positive Argument Stated
- **Details:** Whedon argues that if actions are necessitated, humans aren't truly responsible, and God can't justly hold them accountable.

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 3, Section 1:** [God's moral excellence is necessary, yet virtuous and praiseworthy](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-1-gods-moral-excellence-is-necessary-yet-virtuous-and-praiseworthy) - Edwards argues that necessary actions can be virtuous and praiseworthy, using God as an example.
- **Part 3, Section 2:** [The acts of the will of Jesus Christ's human soul were necessarily holy, yet truly virtuous, praiseworthy, rewardable etc.](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-2-the-acts-of-the-will-of-jesus-christs-human-soul-were-necessarily-holy-yet-truly-virtuous-praiseworthy-rewardable-etc) - Edwards uses Christ's necessary holiness to argue that necessity doesn't eliminate virtue.
- **Part 3, Section 3:** [Moral necessity and inability are consistent with blameworthiness](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-moral-necessity-and-inability-are-consistent-with-blameworthiness-this-is-shown-by-the-case-of-people-whom-god-has-given-up-to-sin-and-of-fallen-man-in-general) - Edwards directly argues that moral necessity is compatible with blameworthiness.
- **Part 3, Section 4:** [Command, and the obligation to obey, are consistent with moral inability to obey](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-command-and-the-obligation-to-obey-are-consistent-with-moral-inability-to-obey) - Edwards argues that commands and obligations are consistent with moral inability.
- **Part 4, Section 3:** [Why some people think it contrary to common sense to suppose that necessary actions can be worthy of either praise or blame](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-why-some-people-think-it-contrary-to-common-sense-to-suppose-that-necessary-actions-can-be-worthy-of-either-praise-or-blame) - Edwards addresses the common sense objection that necessity eliminates responsibility.
- **Part 4, Section 4:** [Moral necessity is consistent with praise and blame, reward and punishment](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-moral-necessity-is-consistent-with-praise-and-blame-reward-and-punishmentthis-squares-with-common-sense-and-mens-natural-notions) - Edwards' main defense that moral necessity is compatible with responsibility.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** True moral responsibility requires that an agent could have done otherwise (libertarian freedom).
- **Minor Premise:** Under determinism/necessity, all actions are necessitated and the agent could not have done otherwise.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, if actions are necessitated, humans are not truly responsible for their actions.
- **Corollary:** If humans are not truly responsible, then God cannot justly hold them accountable or punish them for actions they could not avoid.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Tollens structure). If P (responsibility) requires Q (libertarian freedom), and Q is false (determinism), then P is false.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** Does the major premise assume what needs to be proven? Whedon supports this with the maxim of responsibility and analogies (automaton, watch) that demonstrate the intuitive connection.
  - **False Premise:** Edwards would dispute the major premise, arguing responsibility doesn't require "could have done otherwise." Whedon addresses this by showing Edwards' position leads to contradictions.
  - **Straw Man:** Does this misrepresent determinism? No—Whedon accurately represents Edwards' view that all actions are necessitated.
- **Strengths:** The argument is logically sound and directly addresses the incompatibility between necessity and responsibility.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** The major premise may be contested by compatibilists, but Whedon provides extensive arguments and examples to support it.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Automaton Analogy (Part III, Chapter III):** Whedon uses the example of an automaton (a mechanical machine) to demonstrate that necessitated actions cannot bear moral responsibility. He argues that even if an automaton were endowed with sensibility and consciousness, "it is plain that its sensibility has not endowed it with the possibility of moral blame or merit, and for a very plain reason. It is seen not to be truly the author of its own actions. It moves only as it is moved... It has only the freedom *to*, not the freedom *from*." He deduces the universal law: "no act can be morally obligatory, responsible, or guilty—no agent can be morally obligated, rewardable, or punishable—unless there be in the agent adequate power for other act than the act in question."

2. **The Chalmers Dagger Example (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon cites Dr. Chalmers' illustration of a man seen holding a dagger directed at a sleeper. The spectator would assume moral responsibility, but "one of these assumptions of the intuition would be, underlying the judgment of moral responsibility and desert of divine penalty, that the volition for the act was performed in full power of willing or not willing the performance." If it were discovered that the man was compelled by another, "common sense of course affirms that the supposed assassin is no assassin, and is morally guiltless." Whedon extends this: "suppose that the psychological curtain which covers the movements of mind were lifted up and it were seen that a controlling causation behind the man's Will propelled its springs and, excluding all contrary power, enforced the volition... what then would the moral judgment be? Why should physical chains, binding the arm, any more excuse an act than a ligature, stronger than the iron chain, fastening the Will, excuse the volition?"

3. **Coaction and Necessitation Equivalence (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon demonstrates that "coaction by physical force or necessitation by motive influence places, and equally places, the act out of the power of the agent." He argues: "Now power must underlie obligation. An act for which the agent has not the adequate power both volitional and physical, cannot be the subject of just obligation nor just command. Whether there be a want of power to act, through material obstacle, or a want of power to will, through motive obstacle, from that want of power arises the exclusion of all possible obligation to the act, and all divine requirement."

4. **The Watch Analogy (Part III, Chapter III):** Whedon compares necessitated volitions to a watch: "The highest order of mechanical or automatic excellence is found in a watch... And yet, literally and coolly, we attribute only automatic excellence; and we are utterly unable to see in it the slightest intrinsic trace of moral merit or demerit. We are unable to see in it guilt or good desert; we are, by the very nature of things, compelled to deny of it the possibility of penalty or reward."

**Practical illustrations:**
- Whedon notes that "when necessity commences and normally responsibility is at an end" - showing the direct incompatibility between necessity and responsibility.
- He argues that "necessity is no bar to responsibility" only if we assume libertarian freedom, but if necessitarianism is true, then responsibility is destroyed.

#### Argument 2: Critique of Compatibilism
- **Chapter:** Part II, Section II (The Psychological Argument), especially Chapter II, III, IV
- **Section:** Nature of Motive Influences, Commensurability of Motives
- **Details:** Whedon challenges Edwards' compatibilist position that moral responsibility can coexist with determinism, contending that Edwards' view reduces human agency to mere mechanical responses to the strongest motive, thereby eliminating genuine choice.

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 1, Section 2:** [Determination of the will](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-2-determination-of-the-will) - Edwards defines determination and argues that "What determines the will is the motive that the mind views as the strongest."
- **Part 2, Section 9:** [How acts of the will connect with dictates of the understanding](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-9-how-acts-of-the-will-connect-with-dictates-of-the-understanding) - Edwards argues that acts of will are shaped by the greatest apparent good and that "the soul always wills or chooses whatever appears most agreeable to it."
- **Part 2, Section 10:** [Volition necessarily connected with the influence of motives](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-10-volition-necessarily-connected-with-the-influence-of-motives-criticisms-of-chubbs-doctrines-and-arguments-concerning-freedom-of-the-will) - Edwards argues that every act of will is aroused by some motive and has a necessary connection with its cause.
- **Part 2, Section 6:** [What determines the will in cases where the mind sees the options as perfectly indifferent?](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-6-what-determines-the-will-in-cases-where-the-mind-sees-the-options-as-perfectly-indifferent) - Edwards addresses cases of apparent indifference, arguing that even in these cases the will is determined.
- **Part 3, Section 7:** [Arminian notions of moral agency are inconsistent with all influence of motive and inducement](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-7-arminian-notions-of-moral-agency-are-inconsistent-with-all-influence-of-motive-and-inducement-in-both-virtuous-and-vicious-actions) - Edwards argues that libertarian free will is inconsistent with the influence of motives.
- **Part 4, Section 5:** [Two objections considered: the 'no use trying' objection and the 'mere machines' objection](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-5-two-objections-considered-the-no-use-trying-objection-and--near-the-end--the-mere-machines-objection) - Edwards responds to the objection that his view makes humans mere machines.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** Genuine choice requires the ability to act against one's strongest inclination or motive.
- **Minor Premise:** Edwards' compatibilism defines "free will" as acting according to the strongest motive, which means humans always act in response to the strongest determining factor.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, Edwards' view eliminates genuine choice and reduces human agency to mechanical responses.
- **Corollary:** If there is no genuine choice, then compatibilism fails to preserve moral responsibility in any meaningful sense, despite Edwards' claims.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Ponens structure). The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** Does the major premise assume what needs to be proven? Whedon supports this with examples of people choosing against strongest inclinations and consciousness affirming this power.
  - **Tautology:** Is Edwards' definition of "strongest motive" circular? Whedon shows it is—Edwards defines strongest motive as whatever prevails, making the definition tautological.
  - **False Dichotomy:** Could there be a middle ground? Whedon addresses this by showing that any system without the ability to choose otherwise reduces to mechanism.
- **Strengths:** The argument exposes the circularity in Edwards' definition and demonstrates the reduction to mechanism.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** Some might argue that "acting according to strongest motive" is still a form of choice. Whedon counters by showing this eliminates the ability to choose otherwise, which is essential for genuine choice.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Mechanical Reduction (Part II, Section II):** Whedon demonstrates that Edwards' view reduces volition to mechanical dynamics: "Edwards's application of the logic of mechanical dynamics to Will is not the only possible method of reasoning." He shows that under Edwards' system, "the volition is here no less necessitated, and so no less automatic, than the perception or the desire." The whole series becomes "automatic because all are necessitated, and alike necessitated."

2. **The Strongest Motive Critique (Part II, Chapter II, III):** Whedon extensively critiques Edwards' doctrine of the "strongest motive." He argues that "the strongest motive is but another term for the accorded motive" - meaning Edwards defines the strongest motive circularly as whatever prevails. Whedon shows that "relatively to the prevolitional faculties, the strongest motive often fails; relative to the Will, the strongest motive is but another term for the accorded motive." This reveals that Edwards' definition is tautological.

3. **The Dice Analogy (Part II, Chapter II):** Whedon uses probability theory to show that "the greater intrinsic intensity constitutes an external probability of the proportionate result, yet neither the necessity nor absolute certainty." Just as "a six may be the next cast by a player at dice may be a fair probability... though the stronger probability be against it, it does and may occur," so too can volitions occur against the strongest probability. This demonstrates that volitions are not necessitated by strongest motives.

4. **The Spiritual Machine (Part III, Chapter III):** Whedon argues that Edwards' system creates "a spiritual machine" where "intellect, sensibility, and Will would be its constituents; just as weights, wheels, and hands are the constituents of a clock. And just as the gravitative force may pass from weights to wheels, and from wheels to hands... so may the motive force pass from intellect to sensibility, and from sensibility to Will." Under this system, "the determination of the clock pointer may be no more fixed and necessitated than the determination of a volition."

5. **Edwards' Geometric Freedom Analogy Refuted (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon critiques Edwards' comparison of volitional freedom to geometric necessity, showing that Edwards' own analogy proves volitions are as necessitated as mathematical figures: "the volitions are as free and as necessitated as the nature and intrinsic geometric relations of a mathematical figure. The volition thereby is just as limited to be what it is as a circle is to be a circle." This demonstrates that Edwards' "freedom" is actually necessity.

**Counter-examples:**
- Whedon argues that people can and do choose against their strongest inclinations, demonstrating libertarian freedom in practice.
- He notes that "consciousness affirms the prevalence of strongest motive as a fact, but consciousness also affirms the power of volition against strongest motive-force."

#### Argument 3: God as Author of Sin
- **Chapter:** Part III, Chapter X
- **Section:** Argument from God's Non-Authorship of Sin
- **Details:** He argues that Edwards' framework makes God the ultimate author of sin and evil, since all actions flow from divine determination, which undermines both human moral accountability and divine justice.

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 4, Section 9:** [The objection that the doctrine maintained here implies that God is the author of sin](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-9-the-objection-that-the-doctrine-maintained-here-implies-that-god-is-the-author-of-sin) - Edwards directly addresses this objection, arguing that his doctrine does not make God the author of sin. He distinguishes between God's permission and God's positive causation of sin.
- **Part 4, Section 10:** [Sin's first entrance into the world](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-10-sins-first-entrance-into-the-world) - Edwards addresses how sin first entered the world under his system, arguing that it was appropriate for sin to arise from the imperfection of the creature rather than from God.
- **Part 3, Section 3:** [Moral necessity and inability are consistent with blameworthiness](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-moral-necessity-and-inability-are-consistent-with-blameworthiness-this-is-shown-by-the-case-of-people-whom-god-has-given-up-to-sin-and-of-fallen-man-in-general) - Edwards uses examples of people given up to sin to argue that moral necessity is consistent with blameworthiness, implicitly addressing the relationship between divine determination and human responsibility.
- **Part 2, Section 11:** [The evidence that God has certain foreknowledge of the volitions of moral agents](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-11-the-evidence-that-god-has-certain-foreknowledge-of-the-volitions-of-moral-agents) - Edwards argues for God's foreknowledge, which Whedon shows implies divine determination.
- **Part 2, Section 12:** [God can't have certain foreknowledge of the future volitions of moral agents if they are contingent](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-12-god-cant-have-certain-foreknowledge-of-the-future-volitions-of-moral-agents-if-they-are-contingent-in-a-way-that-excludes-all-necessity) - Edwards argues that God's foreknowledge requires necessity, which Whedon shows makes God the determiner of all actions.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** Under determinism, all actions (including sinful ones) are ultimately determined by God's will and decree.
- **Minor Premise:** If God determines all actions, then God is the ultimate cause and author of those actions, including sin and evil.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, Edwards' deterministic framework makes God the ultimate author of sin and evil.
- **Corollary 1:** If God is the author of sin, then human moral accountability is undermined, as humans are merely executing what God has determined.
- **Corollary 2:** If God is the author of sin, then divine justice is undermined, as God cannot justly punish what He Himself has authored and determined.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Ponens structure). The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **False Premise:** Does determinism necessarily mean God determines all actions? Whedon shows that under Edwards' system, God's foreknowledge requires determinism, and determinism requires a first cause, which is God.
  - **Distinction Without Difference:** Does Edwards' distinction between "permission" and "positive causation" avoid the conclusion? Whedon shows it doesn't—the brick and telegraph cable analogies demonstrate that intermediate causes don't absolve the first cause.
  - **Begging the Question:** Does this assume that determining an action makes one its "author"? Whedon supports this with analogies and common sense notions of responsibility.
- **Strengths:** The argument is logically sound and uses powerful analogies to demonstrate the chain of causation.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** Edwards attempts to distinguish between positive and privative causation. Whedon refutes this by showing that under determinism, even privative causation becomes positive.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Brick Analogy (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon uses a powerful analogy: "Suppose a boy upon a high scaffold intentionally so arranges a number of standing bricks in a row, that when he pushes down the first, that shall push down the second, and the second the third, and so on, so that the last brick, according to his purpose, shall fall upon the head of a sleeping man, and fulfill his intention of murdering him. Would the act be less guilty or the boy less responsible than if he had crushed the man with a single brick?" He applies this to God's causation: "The causative force from his finger ran in a right line through all the bricks and murdered the man. The intention of the act ran through all the bricks and achieved the crime." Similarly, "From the Will of God to the act of the sinner the line of causation through all the intermediates is a straight line. And to all the purposes of just responsibility it is a short line—a point."

2. **Edwards' Self-Contradiction (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon exposes a remarkable contradiction: "Edwards next proceeds to the Scripture Argument... These passages either prove God's necessitation of sin, or his mere permission or non-prevention. By Edwards's own argument they cannot mean the former; for he asserts there is nothing but mere permission. If there be nothing but mere permission, then they make nothing against Arminianism." Whedon shows that Edwards "defends only the theory of non-prevention! He seems to forget to which side he belongs, and quietly exculpates his opponents, the non-preventionists, from charging God with the authorship of sin."

3. **The Telegraph Cable Analogy (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon argues: "Should the superintendent of an Atlantic telegraphic cable intentionally so manipulate as to transmit to another continent a malignant falsehood, the wickedness of the deed would not be diminished by the length of the cable. No matter through how many inches or particles of matter the lie has to pass, its guilt is as if the whole were done by nothing but a lying volition and a lying tongue." Similarly, "Every human act of overt sin passes through countless particles of matter... Yet through all the necessitative series, the intentional causer of the first movement is responsible author of the last effect."

4. **Privative Causation Refuted (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon refutes Edwards' attempt to distinguish between positive and privative causation: "Necessity makes God the positive and not merely the negative cause of sin. God according to Necessity positively sets all the first causes and materials in existence and action; just as the boy arranges the bricks and throws down the first, which throws down all to the last." He further argues: "Necessity makes God positively cause the privative defectus, which demands the supply of remedy... The very privative thereby becomes positive."

5. **The Chain of Causation (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon demonstrates: "In the question of responsibility for an intended effect, it makes no difference no matter how through how many intermediate necessary causes the causation has to pass from the first cause to the last effect... The first intentional causer is the responsible author of the final intended effect... The whole series is responsibly one ACT; the final effect is the one act."

**Edwards' attempts to avoid this conclusion:**
- Whedon shows that Edwards' distinction between "willing sin as sin" fails: "None but the most depraved among men and the devils do will 'sin as sin'... Men have no specific appetite for sin as sin. The great majority of sins are committed for the sake of some good which the sinner sees in them." But under determinism, "God necessitates his existence, his nature, his sin, and his damnation for that necessitated nature and sin."

**Biblical/scriptural references:**
- Whedon notes that Edwards cites cases of Pharaoh, Joseph's brethren, the king of Assyria, Nebuchadnezzar, and the crucifiers of Christ, but these passages "either prove God's necessitation of sin, or his mere permission or non-prevention" - and Edwards' own argument shows they cannot mean necessitation.

#### Argument 4: Incoherence of Edwards' System
- **Chapter:** Part III, Chapter IX, Chapter X
- **Section:** Coaction and Necessitation; God's Non-Authorship of Sin
- **Details:** Whedon maintains that Edwards' attempt to preserve responsibility while denying libertarian freedom creates an incoherent system that fails to justify God's governance or human culpability.

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 3, Section 1-4:** These sections collectively attempt to show that necessity is compatible with responsibility (God's virtue, Christ's virtue, moral inability consistent with blameworthiness, commands consistent with inability). Whedon shows these create contradictions.
  - [Part 3, Section 1: God's moral excellence is necessary, yet virtuous and praiseworthy](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-1-gods-moral-excellence-is-necessary-yet-virtuous-and-praiseworthy)
  - [Part 3, Section 2: The acts of the will of Jesus Christ's human soul were necessarily holy](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-2-the-acts-of-the-will-of-jesus-christs-human-soul-were-necessarily-holy-yet-truly-virtuous-praiseworthy-rewardable-etc)
  - [Part 3, Section 3: Moral necessity and inability are consistent with blameworthiness](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-moral-necessity-and-inability-are-consistent-with-blameworthiness-this-is-shown-by-the-case-of-people-whom-god-has-given-up-to-sin-and-of-fallen-man-in-general)
  - [Part 3, Section 4: Command, and the obligation to obey, are consistent with moral inability to obey](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-command-and-the-obligation-to-obey-are-consistent-with-moral-inability-to-obey) - Edwards argues that commands are consistent with moral inability, which Whedon shows is contradictory if the will is necessitated.
- **Part 4, Section 3:** [Why some people think it contrary to common sense to suppose that necessary actions can be worthy of either praise or blame](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-why-some-people-think-it-contrary-to-common-sense-to-suppose-that-necessary-actions-can-be-worthy-of-either-praise-or-blame) - Edwards acknowledges the common sense objection but tries to reconcile it.
- **Part 4, Section 4:** [Moral necessity is consistent with praise and blame, reward and punishment](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-moral-necessity-is-consistent-with-praise-and-blame-reward-and-punishmentthis-squares-with-common-sense-and-mens-natural-notions) - Edwards' main attempt to reconcile necessity with responsibility, which Whedon shows is incoherent.
- **Part 4, Section 5:** [Two objections considered: the 'no use trying' objection and the 'mere machines' objection](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-5-two-objections-considered-the-no-use-trying-objection-and--near-the-end--the-mere-machines-objection) - Edwards responds to objections that his view makes trying useless and humans mere machines, but Whedon shows his responses are inconsistent with his determinism.
- **Part 4, Section 9:** [The objection that the doctrine maintained here implies that God is the author of sin](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-9-the-objection-that-the-doctrine-maintained-here-implies-that-god-is-the-author-of-sin) - Edwards' attempt to avoid making God the author of sin, which Whedon shows contradicts his determinism.
- **Part 1, Section 5:** [The notions of liberty and moral agency](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-5-the-notions-of-liberty-and-moral-agency) - Edwards defines liberty as "the power, opportunity, or advantage that anyone has to do as he pleases" while denying libertarian freedom, creating the incoherence Whedon identifies.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** Moral responsibility logically requires libertarian freedom (the ability to choose otherwise).
- **Minor Premise:** Edwards denies libertarian freedom while simultaneously attempting to preserve moral responsibility.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, Edwards' system is logically incoherent, as it attempts to maintain responsibility without its necessary condition.
- **Corollary 1:** This incoherence means Edwards' system fails to provide a coherent justification for God's governance, as governance requires accountability which requires freedom.
- **Corollary 2:** This incoherence means Edwards' system fails to provide a coherent basis for human culpability, as culpability requires genuine agency which Edwards' determinism eliminates.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Reductio ad Absurdum structure). If P requires Q, and Q is denied while P is maintained, the system is incoherent.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** Does the major premise assume what needs to be proven? Whedon supports this with the maxim of responsibility, analogies, and the reality that responsibility exists.
  - **False Premise:** Could responsibility exist without libertarian freedom? Edwards argues yes, but Whedon shows this leads to contradictions (God as author of sin, humans as machines).
  - **Straw Man:** Does this misrepresent Edwards' position? No—Whedon accurately shows Edwards both denies libertarian freedom and attempts to preserve responsibility.
- **Strengths:** The argument uses reductio ad absurdum effectively, showing that Edwards' system leads to contradictions.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** Edwards would dispute the major premise, but Whedon provides extensive arguments showing that without libertarian freedom, responsibility becomes impossible.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **Edwards' Self-Contradiction on Responsibility (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon identifies a fundamental contradiction: Edwards argues that "necessity is no bar to responsibility" and that "we are responsible for our beliefs, because we can help our bad beliefs by our Wills; and we are under obligation to help our bad beliefs by our Wills because our Wills are not necessitated to leave our bad beliefs unchanged." But Whedon shows this is circular: "Responsibility for belief therefore demonstrates the freedom of the Will." If Edwards denies freedom, he cannot maintain responsibility.

2. **The Imprisoned Man Example (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon exposes the contradiction in Edwards' treatment of inability: "The necessitarian will put this case. Here is a man who ought to support his family by honest labor; but he is imprisoned and in chains. Does not that excuse him? Yes. Then 'natural,' that is, corporeal, inability discharges obligation. But suppose he is fully at liberty, but has no will, disposition, or inclination; does that excuse him? No. Then moral, that is, volitional, inability does not excuse." Whedon replies: "that 'no' is given under assumption that the Will is non-necessitated and that necessitarianism is false. The true answer, then, to be substituted is this: 'If necessitarianism is false, no; if necessitarianism is true, yes.' No necessitarian has a right to utter that Arminian 'no.'"

3. **Edwards Defends Arminianism (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon shows that Edwards contradicts his own system: "Edwards next proceeds to the Scripture Argument... These passages either prove God's necessitation of sin, or his mere permission or non-prevention. By Edwards's own argument they cannot mean the former; for he asserts there is nothing but mere permission. If there be nothing but mere permission, then they make nothing against Arminianism. He quotes but does not analyze them on this point; very much as if he meant, non-committally, to have a causation, and a necessitation of sin, by the reader inferred, which he thought not best explicitly himself to express." Edwards "defends only the theory of non-prevention! He seems to forget to which side he belongs, and quietly exculpates his opponents, the non-preventionists."

4. **The Geometric Freedom Contradiction (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon shows that Edwards' own analogy proves the incoherence: Edwards compares volitional freedom to geometric necessity, but this demonstrates that "the volitions are as free and as necessitated as the nature and intrinsic geometric relations of a mathematical figure. The volition thereby is just as limited to be what it is as a circle is to be a circle... Whether, therefore, he wills or does, if he be responsible at all, he is responsible for what he cannot help." This shows the contradiction: Edwards claims responsibility while admitting the agent "cannot help" what he does.

5. **The System Becomes Mechanical (Part III, Chapter III):** Whedon demonstrates that Edwards' system reduces to pure mechanism: "Men are the mechanically moving parts of a great mechanical counterpart—both forming one stupendous machine. And this frames the Universe, including God and man, into one infinite eternal machine; than which nothing can be more contradictory to the idea of a moral government." Under this system, "the system is then mechanical, not retributive" - showing that Edwards' attempt to preserve retributive justice fails.

**Logical analysis:**
- Whedon uses reductio ad absurdum: If Edwards' system is true, then God is the author of sin, humans are machines, and responsibility is impossible. But Edwards claims responsibility is possible. Therefore, Edwards' system is incoherent.

**Practical implications:**
- Whedon shows that under Edwards' system, "governance requires accountability which requires freedom" - but Edwards denies freedom, so governance becomes impossible.
- The system "fails to provide a coherent basis for human culpability, as culpability requires genuine agency which Edwards' determinism eliminates."

#### Argument 5: Libertarian Free Will as Alternative
- **Chapter:** Throughout, especially Part I (The Issue Stated), Part III (The Positive Argument)
- **Section:** Freedom of the Will Defined; Conditions and Limitations of Will's Free Action
- **Details:** The book champions the idea that humans possess a genuine ability to choose between alternatives, even against strong inclinations, a concept Edwards rejected.

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 2, Section 1:** [The Arminian notion of liberty of will as consisting in the will's self-determining power—its obvious inconsistency](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-1-the-arminian-notion-of-liberty-of-will-as-consisting-in-the-wills-self-determining-powerits-obvious-inconsistency) - Edwards argues that self-determining power is logically inconsistent and involves infinite regress.
- **Part 2, Section 2:** [Two attempted escapes from the foregoing reasoning](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-2-two-attempted-escapes-from-the-foregoing-reasoning) - Edwards addresses attempts to escape his argument against self-determination.
- **Part 2, Section 3:** [Can volition occur without a cause? Can any event do so?](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-can-volition-occur-without-a-cause-can-any-event-do-so) - Edwards argues that every event requires a cause, including volitions.
- **Part 2, Section 4:** [Can volition occur without a cause because the soul is active?](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-can-volition-occur-without-a-cause-because-the-soul-is-active) - Edwards argues that the soul's activeness doesn't allow uncaused volitions.
- **Part 2, Section 7:** [The view that freedom of the will consists in indifference](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-7-the-view-that-freedom-of-the-will-consists-in-indifference) - Edwards argues against the view that freedom requires indifference or equilibrium.
- **Part 2, Section 8:** [The view that freedom of the will rules out every kind of necessity](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-8-the-view-that-freedom-of-the-will-rules-out-every-kind-of-necessity) - Edwards argues that volitions cannot be contingent in a way that excludes all necessity.
- **Part 2, Section 13:** [Even if the volitions of moral agents are not connected with anything antecedent, they must be 'necessary' in a sense that overthrows Arminian liberty](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-13-even-if-the-volitions-of-moral-agents-are-not-connected-with-anything-antecedent-they-must-be-necessary-in-a-sense-that-overthrows-arminian-liberty) - Edwards argues that even uncaused volitions would be necessary.
- **Part 3, Section 6:** [Liberty of indifference, rather than being required for virtue, is inconsistent with it](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-6-liberty-of-indifference-rather-than-being-required-for-virtue-is-inconsistent-with-it-more-generally-liberty-and-moral-agency-on-the-arminian-pattern-are-inconsistent-with-any-habits-or-inclinations-being-virtuous-or-vicious) - Edwards argues that libertarian freedom (indifference) is inconsistent with virtue rather than required for it.
- **Part 4, Section 1:** [What makes dispositions of the heart and acts of the will vicious or virtuous is not their cause but their nature](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-1-what-makes-dispositions-of-the-heart-and-acts-of-the-will-vicious-or-virtuous-is-not-their-cause-but-their-nature) - Edwards argues against the Arminian view that virtue requires libertarian freedom, claiming virtue depends on nature not cause.
- **Part 1, Section 5:** [The notions of liberty and moral agency](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-5-the-notions-of-liberty-and-moral-agency) - Edwards defines liberty in compatibilist terms (doing as one pleases) while rejecting the Arminian definition that requires self-determination, indifference, and contingency.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** True moral responsibility and just divine governance require that humans possess genuine freedom to choose between alternatives.
- **Minor Premise:** Libertarian free will provides genuine freedom by allowing humans to choose between alternatives, even against strong inclinations or motives.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, libertarian free will is necessary and sufficient for true moral responsibility and just divine governance.
- **Corollary:** Since Edwards rejected libertarian free will, his system cannot provide an adequate foundation for moral responsibility or divine justice, making libertarian free will the superior alternative.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Ponens structure). The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** Does the major premise assume what needs to be proven? Whedon supports this with the maxim of responsibility, the reality of moral accountability, and the requirements of just governance.
  - **False Dilemma:** Could there be other foundations for morality? Whedon addresses this by showing that compatibilism fails, making libertarian freedom the only viable option.
  - **Circular Reasoning:** Does the argument assume responsibility exists to prove freedom exists? No—Whedon uses the acknowledged reality of responsibility to demonstrate the necessity of freedom.
- **Strengths:** The argument is logically sound and provides a positive alternative to Edwards' system.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** The claim that libertarian free will is "sufficient" may need qualification—other conditions (knowledge, rationality) may also be required. However, Whedon's focus is on showing it's necessary, which is well-supported.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Theory of Non-Prevention (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon presents the libertarian alternative: "The former maintains that while God foreknows that in a given course of the most wise divine conduct a free agent will, with full power to do otherwise, bring sin into existence, he, nevertheless, neither destroys the agent nor prevents his sin, but prosecutes his own course of most perfect wisdom to the best result. This may be called the theory of NON-PREVENTION." This preserves both divine sovereignty and human freedom.

2. **Freedom Between Two Necessities (Part II, Chapter II):** Whedon describes the area of freedom: "It is in this interval of area, between opposite necessities, where event may overrule probabilities, that freedom and responsibility exist. As human perception covers a narrow interspace between two unknowables, so human freedom covers a narrow interspace between two necessities." This shows that freedom operates in a real but bounded space.

3. **Power to Choose Against Strongest Motive (Part II, Chapter II, III):** Whedon demonstrates that "consciousness also affirms the power of volition against strongest motive-force" and that "there was power to reject the so-called strongest motive." He argues that "the Will to choose counter strongest motive-force" is a real power that humans possess.

4. **The Law of Invariability Does Not Apply (Part II, Chapter II):** Whedon shows that volitions are not subject to mechanical laws: "The maxim that 'the effect is the measure of the cause' has a double meaning... In the former case the effect is not only the measure, but the manifestation of the antecedent intrinsic amount of causation... Such is the fact in all cases of physical or non-volitional causation. The effect, on the contrary, can be only a conventional or assigned measure, when there is no exact intrinsic proportion in the causality." Volitions belong to the latter category.

5. **Responsibility Demonstrates Freedom (Part III, Chapter IX):** Whedon argues: "We are responsible for our beliefs, because we can help our bad beliefs by our Wills; and we are under obligation to help our bad beliefs by our Wills because our Wills are not necessitated to leave our bad beliefs unchanged. Responsibility for belief therefore demonstrates the freedom of the Will." This shows that the reality of responsibility proves the reality of freedom.

**Positive examples of libertarian freedom:**
- Whedon notes that people regularly choose virtue "against the strongest motives for evil" and that "for virtue itself against the strongest motives" demonstrates genuine libertarian freedom.
- He argues that the ability to resist temptation, even when repeated, shows libertarian freedom in action.

**Comparison with Edwards:**
- Whedon contrasts the two systems: Necessitarianism teaches that "God necessitates his existence, his nature, his sin, and his damnation for that necessitated nature and sin. Man has no adequate ability for different existence, choice, act, or destiny." Libertarianism teaches that "God foreknows that in a given course... a free agent will, with full power to do otherwise, bring sin into existence" - preserving both divine wisdom and human responsibility.

**Practical benefits:**
- Libertarian free will provides "a true basis for human moral responsibility and a just divine government, preventing God from being the author of sin."
- It allows for genuine moral accountability: "no act can be morally obligatory, responsible, or guilty—no agent can be morally obligated, rewardable, or punishable—unless there be in the agent adequate power for other act than the act in question."
- It preserves divine justice: God can justly hold humans accountable because they genuinely could have done otherwise.
