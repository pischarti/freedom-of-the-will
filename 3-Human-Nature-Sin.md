# Human Nature & Sin

## Overview

Whedon addresses the fallen human condition, agreeing that sin influences choices, but posits that God's grace provides the opportunity to overcome this bondage through libertarian freedom, allowing for true resistance and redemption. He argues that fallen human nature creates strong inclinations toward sin but does not eliminate the power to choose otherwise, and that genuine redemption requires genuine choice, not merely necessitated responses to grace.

### Argument: Grace Enables Without Necessitating

- **Chapter:** Part III, Chapter X; Part II, Section III, Chapter IX, X
- **Section:** The Free Appropriation of Our Depraved Nature; Responsibility of Obdurates and of Fallen Man
- **Details:** Whedon addresses the fallen human condition, agreeing that sin influences choices, but posits that God's grace provides the opportunity to overcome this bondage through libertarian freedom, allowing for true resistance and redemption.

**Syllogistic Breakdown:**
- **Major Premise:** Fallen human nature creates strong inclinations toward sin, but does not eliminate the power to choose otherwise (libertarian freedom).
- **Minor Premise:** God's grace provides the opportunity and enablement to overcome sinful inclinations, but does not necessitate the choice.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, humans can genuinely resist sin and choose redemption through libertarian freedom, even in their fallen state.
- **Corollary 1:** The fallen nature creates a "probational crisis" where genuine choice between sin and righteousness is possible.
- **Corollary 2:** True redemption requires genuine choice, not merely necessitated responses to grace.

**Fallacy Checks:**
- **Logical Validity:** ✓ Valid (Modus Ponens structure). The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
- **Potential Objections:**
  - **Begging the Question:** Does the major premise assume libertarian freedom exists? Whedon provides independent arguments (from consciousness, responsibility, etc.) that support this premise.
  - **Straw Man:** Does this misrepresent Edwards' view of moral inability? Whedon directly quotes and analyzes Edwards' positions to show this is a fair representation.
  - **False Premise:** Could fallen nature actually eliminate the power to choose otherwise? Whedon addresses this by distinguishing between strong inclination (which exists) and absolute necessity (which he argues does not).
- **Strengths:** The argument is logically sound and addresses the key distinction between influence and necessitation.
- **Weaknesses to Consider:** Some might argue that "strong inclinations" are effectively the same as necessity. Whedon counters this by showing that people do choose against their strongest inclinations, demonstrating libertarian freedom in practice.

**Examples and Demonstrations:**

**From Whedon's book:**

1. **The Free Appropriation of Depraved Nature (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon addresses how individuals appropriate their fallen nature: "The individual freedom and collective necessity" work together. He argues that "our fallen state, and forms an average probational crisis" where genuine choice is possible. "The Cross is the key to unlock the door of escape from our fallen inability."

2. **Nature of Fallen Inability (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon distinguishes between different types of inability: "The total inability of fallen man, apart from all provision of grace, is not a natural but a moral inability." He shows that this moral inability does not eliminate libertarian freedom: "The nature of our fallen inability" allows for "the free appropriation" of grace.

3. **Responsibility of Fallen Man (Part II, Section III, Chapter IX):** Whedon addresses Edwards' position on fallen humanity: "As to Fallen Race—three positions of Edwards" are examined. He argues that even fallen man retains libertarian freedom and can be held responsible: "Responsibility of fallen man is a possibility" because "the infant is in the basis of common redemption."

4. **Childhood Probational Crisis (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon describes how individuals face choices: "Childhood probational crisis" represents the point where genuine choice becomes possible. He argues that "individual freedom and collective necessity" interact, allowing for genuine moral decisions even within a fallen race.

5. **Discriminations of Guilt and Guiltlessness (Part III, Chapter X):** Whedon shows that genuine freedom allows for proper moral discrimination: "Discriminations of guilt and guiltlessness" are possible because individuals can genuinely choose. He argues that "the varying nature" of sin "requires a varying response" that only libertarian freedom can provide.

**Comparison with Edwards:**

**Relevant Sections from Edwards' *Freedom of the Will*:**
- **Part 3, Section 3:** [Moral necessity and inability are consistent with blameworthiness. This is shown by the case of people whom God has given up to sin, and of fallen man in general](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-3-moral-necessity-and-inability-are-consistent-with-blameworthiness-this-is-shown-by-the-case-of-people-whom-god-has-given-up-to-sin-and-of-fallen-man-in-general) - Edwards argues that moral inability (lack of inclination) is consistent with blameworthiness, using examples of people given up to sin and fallen humanity. Whedon shows this is contradictory if the will is necessitated.
- **Part 3, Section 4:** [Command, and the obligation to obey, are consistent with moral inability to obey](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-4-command-and-the-obligation-to-obey-are-consistent-with-moral-inability-to-obey) - Edwards argues that commands and obligations are consistent with moral inability, which Whedon shows eliminates genuine responsibility if the will cannot choose otherwise.
- **Part 4, Section 5:** [Two objections considered: the 'no use trying' objection and the 'mere machines' objection](./Freedom-of-the-Will-Jonathan-Edwards.md#section-5-two-objections-considered-the-no-use-trying-objection-and--near-the-end--the-mere-machines-objection) - Edwards responds to objections about trying and being mere machines, but Whedon shows his responses are inconsistent with determinism.

**Key Differences:**
- Whedon agrees that sin influences choices but denies that it eliminates the power to choose otherwise.
- He argues that Edwards' view of "moral inability" actually eliminates genuine responsibility, while libertarian freedom preserves it.
- Grace enables but does not necessitate; it provides opportunity for genuine choice.

**Practical benefits:**
- Libertarian freedom allows for genuine resistance to sin, even in fallen humanity.
- God's grace provides enablement without eliminating human agency.
- True redemption requires genuine choice, making it meaningful and responsible.
