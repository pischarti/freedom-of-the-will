[*The Freedom of the Will as a Basis of Human Responsibility and a Divine Government*](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Freedom+of+the+Will+as+a+Basis+of+Human+Responsibility+and+a+Divine+Government&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari&ved=2ahUKEwj0hMiYs4mSAxVK5MkDHQ2SIlYQgK4QegQIARAB), by Daniel D. Whedon, is a Wesleyan/Arminian critique of Jonathan Edwards' Calvinistic view of free will, arguing that true moral responsibility requires genuine libertarian freedom (the ability to choose otherwise), not just acting on strongest desires, and that Edwards failed to reconcile his deterministic view with God's just governance, proposing instead that God's grace is resistible, allowing for real human choice in salvation, making God's rule more impressive and less contradictory.

Here's a breakdown of its core arguments:

- **Critique of Edwards:** [1-Critique-of-Edwards.md](./1-Critique-of-Edwards.md)
- **Reconciling God's Sovereignty & Human Freedom:** [2-God-Sovereignty-Human-Freedom.md](./2-God-Sovereignty-Human-Freedom.md)
- **Human Nature & Sin:** [3-Human-Nature-Sin.md](./3-Human-Nature-Sin.md)
- **Basis for Morality:** [4-Basis-for-Morality.md](./4-Basis-for-Morality.md)

In essence, Whedon's work is a classic defense of Arminian theology, arguing that without libertarian free will, both human moral accountability and a perfectly just God are undermined.
